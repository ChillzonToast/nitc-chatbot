Event website File:Floss meet 05.jpg Blogs Dilip V Atul Chitnis [...] I started with an introduction of FOSS, and ended with an overview of FOSS in India. Hopefully, I will have made things clear enough to people to get them excited and (more importantly) involved. Lots of questions after the talk, so I am hopeful that the talk was useful to the 100+ people in the audience. [...] Slides Swaroop CH [...] Soon, Pradeep and myself took over the stage and we started asking the students about what their previous programming experience and what they are interested in. Almost all students knew C++ and didn’t know Perl. So, yaay! They hadn’t been spoilt by Perl and we knew it would be exciting to introduce them to a clean language like Python to C++ students. [...] Other Blog entries from Swaroop Python workshop at NIT Calicut Talk at FLOSS Meet tomorrow Trek at Thusharagiri Pradeep Kishore Gowda [...] I’m back from Calicut after giving a talk on Python @ NIT Calicut’s Free/Libre Open Source software meet. Me and Swaroop talked about Python for nearly 3 hours. Going by the number of questions that were asked and the students approaching us to talk in the lunch break, I’m sure there are a new bunch of Pythonistas in Calicut :) This was my largest audience so far with nearly 150 people comprising of students and staff. [...] Shankar Balan [...] Back from the Floss meet at NIT, Calicut where I gave a presentation on BSD titled - The Devil's Side of OpenSource. At the start of the talk there were < 5 in the audience who were aware of BSD, the number should now be > 125 at least. :) [...] photos Pradeep's flickr galley Swaroop's flickr album FOSS Meet @ NITC 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Retrieved from ‘https://wiki.fosscell.org/index.php?title=FOSSMEET_2005&oldid=16’",

We had a lot of fun and I mean, A LOT. And the conference is really good, the kids do use Fedora on the desktop in their labs. The XGL demos were a particular attraction last year. No Calicut for me Atul Chitnis [...] NITC's FOSS event has grown in stature, and is quickly becoming one of the recognized FOSS events in India, along with Gnunify, Freedel and of course FOSS.IN.[...] In Calicut this weekend Pradeepto [...]Today, I was supposed to leave for Calicut to attend FOSS.NITC which starts tomorrow. I should be in Netravati at the moment but I am not thanks to certain issues that cropped up in the morning and I realised that I can't go today :/, I immediately booked tomorrow's flight tickets to Calicut as I didn't want to miss the conference.[...] Good service is appreciated. Parthan [...] The organizers, students belonging to various branches in NITC, did a very nice job. This is their 3rd year of conducting the FOSS meet and they did show signs of maturity.[...] First day of talks at FOSS.NITC FOSS.NITC Field Report Aanjhan [...] It still amazes me “How in such a short span of time these NITC Folks have managed to make FOSS.NITC a nationwide Community event”. Keep it up guys.[...] FOSS.NITC - Filled with Fun and Learning Vivek Khurana [...] I attended recently concluded foss.nitc in Calicut. Conducted in fluctuating weather of Kerla, foss.nitc was hosted inside beautiful NIT Calicut campus, few kilometers away from civilization.

      "content": "Welcome to Foss Cell NITC This is a wiki based website for the Free and Open Source Software Community at NITC. What is FOSS? Free software is a matter of the users' freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. More precisely, it refers to four kinds of freedom, for the users of the software: The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0). The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2). The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition for this. For more information, please visit http://gnu.org Vision Free and Open Source Software is much more than a superior technology. It is a philosophy which lays emphasis on the rights of a user to copy, study, modify and redistribute code. It is based on the belief that Knowledge is a common heritage of mankind, and thus software, a form of knowledge, has to be free and accessible to all. Our vision is a society where the sharing of Knowledge is the norm, rather than the exception. Action Plan Popularize the use and spread awareness, in the campus, about the advantages of using Free Software, through demonstrations, installation fests etc. Provide support to nearby schools for the IT@School programme. Encourage students to get involved in Free Software development- both community Free Software projects and events like the Google Summer of Code. Discuss how and why FOSS can be used effectively in the curriculum, probably replacing proprietary tools. Initiative to develop FOSS tools in areas where they are lacking. Probably these can be taken up by students as part of their project work. Join with the NITC chapters of IEEE, CSI etc. to conduct events like FOSSMeet@NITC.

Founded in the 1960s, the club aims at functioning as an industrial interface for students, endowing them with vital professional values to stand out from the crowd. In the 60s, at its very nascent stages, the forum focused on providing first-hand industrial exposure to students. Over the years the club has progressed into adopting more vantage points, hence evolving into what it is today. The club is dedicated to inculcating and bracing an entrepreneurial cognition in the student community. Notable accomplishments of the club include the collaboration with the London School of Economics for previous MUNs. The club is also known for its impressive and intriguing Instagram series which unfolds lesser known corporate backstories and renders accounts on the most off-the-wall lucrative ideas. The club endeavors to comprehensively improve managerial skills and train students in a host of disciplines so that no potential goes unfulfilled.

The campus is situated 22 kilometres (14 mi) north east of Kozhikode, on the Kozhikode–Mukkam Road. It was established in 1961 and was known as Calicut Regional Engineering College (CREC) until 2002. It is one of the National Institutes of Technology campuses established by the Government of India for imparting high standard technical education to students from all over the country. NIT Calicut hosts a supercomputer on its campus,[6] and has a dedicated nanotechnology department. History Intial Years: National Institute of Technology, Calicut was set up in 1961 as Regional Engineering College Calicut (CREC), the ninth of its kind and the first one to be established during the Third Five-Year Plan period. Until the formation of Calicut University in 1963, the institute was affiliated with Kerala University. It was largely due to the efforts of Pattom Thanu Pillai, then Chief Minister of Kerala, that the institute came into being. Prof. S. Rajaraman, first principal of Government Engineering College, Thrissur was appointed as the special officer in 1961 to organise the activities of the college until M. V. Kesava Rao took charge as the first principal of the college. The classes were initially held at the Government Polytechnic at West Hill, before it moved to its present campus in 1963. The college started with an annual intake of 125 students for the undergraduate courses, on a campus of 120 hectares (1.2 km2; 300 acres).

The Centre for Cultural and Art Relations (CCAR) was established with the primary goal of making engineering education more multidisciplinary and improving students' learning experiences through the incorporation of fine and performing arts into the curriculum, both of which are clearly aligned with the NEP2020 vision statements. The centre aims to provide holistic education with innovation and style by combining arts and engineering, which may give our young minds a new way of seeing, perceiving, and interacting with their world, leaving an indelible impression on their senses. It aspires to be a hub of art in practice and discourse within NITC. Public event programmes, workshops, research, and pedagogy are all expected to help build a community of artistic-engineers interested in the intersections of art, culture, and technology. The centre strives to collaborate with cultural and artistic talents at the regional, national, and international levels in order to build bridges with the community in novel and exciting ways.

The minutes are as follows: The meeting started off with an explanation of the importance of the code of procedure and the councillors were requested to convey the same to their peers. Due to the delay in obtaining permission for the SAC room from DSW, the office duties of the councillors will be announced at a later date. A sub-committee for animal welfare was formed, anyone who wishes to be a part of the committee can send an email to Students Affairs Council NITC. To record the meetings between students and the admin It was understood that recording the meetings wouldn't be a suitable solution so it was decided that the Branch representative or the Class representative could accompany the student if the student is unwilling to attend the meeting with admin alone. The Branch/Class representative should take note of any mishappenings and should report to SAC. To record the meetings between the SAC EC and DSW The minutes of the meetings between DSW and SAC EC are properly kept. Election rules and the role of international students. The election rules for the upcoming SAC EC elections are yet to be finalised. A proposal to introduce a separate councillor post for international students was put forth and it was decided that a final decision on the matter would be made after a poll during the next SAC RM. Stipend and TA Distribution Issue Talks with the administration are ongoing to resolve the issues faced For further clarification on the matter please contact P G Academic Secretary Placement Section in the SAC app Information on companies visiting campus and other details are available in the placement section of the SAC app. The SAC app can be downloaded by clicking here. Talks will be held with the administration to use alternatives to card payment in the administrative block for various payments. A debate regarding the animal welfare issue was made and it was decided that a meeting would be held between SAC and the Animal Welfare Club and the suggestions will be put forth in the upcoming SAC meeting for approval. Night mess Available in D hostel from 10th January A and B hostel will open night mess during exam weeks, the talks about extension are in consideration. Andhra mess There will be an Andhra mess functioning in E mess, the quotation for the same will be called in soon. The OAT food court won't be opened since it is supposed to be a convocation hall. The institute properties are for the students and the students should have their say in having a canteen. SAC needs to push forward with the demand of opening a canteen near OAT where quality food is served at a lower price. Opening of MHB-1 gate The director’s policy of minimising the number of entries. For the geysers in MHB-2, a company's quotation was received and given for its quality check. The Hostel Affairs Secretary Students Affairs Council has instructed the students to follow the code of procedures. For any hostel-related issues, it is recommended to contact the respective caretaker, hostel representative, mess secretary etc first. Late-night placement exams Students have elective classes which might extend till 7 pm Regarding attendance condonation given by CCD, some faculties are already giving condonation, reduction of credits from 160 to 151 is not possible as it needs an academic curriculum change, students can overload the subjects during the previous semesters to go for a 6-month internship during the final semester. This issue has been resolved for the B23 admission with their new academic curriculum. PG students pointed out that failing one core subject, they need to wait for one year to repeat the course. It was already mentioned during admission itself that the core courses should be taken seriously. The issues related to the theft of bicycles and vehicles from the institute parking area were discussed and it was decided that a meeting with the administration would be held to resolve the concerns. No classrooms for M.tech 2nd year students The P G Academic Secretary will talk with department heads to allow classrooms to be given for the same. GSB pointed out the absence of many of the SAC councillors, and SAC EC members and the early departure of some of the members, as a solution to this issue the following suggestions were made: In case any of the EC members are unable to attend the meeting, there should be at least one member from each of the Executive councils present for the SAC RM; the EC member can entrust any of his/her council members to attend the meeting on his/her behalf.

The Director highlighted recent security issues faced by female students, deeming them alarming. To mitigate such incidents, it was decided against the demands of the students that only a minimal number of operational gates should be maintained. The safety of the campus community was cited as the utmost priority. Emphasizing the need for heightened vigilance and control over narcotics within the campus, the Director directed that any narcotics-related cases be handed over directly to the local police station. Road Maintenance and Transportation on campus The Director outlined ambitious projects, including the construction of a subway from the main campus to the library and new roads connecting the new library and the mega boys' hostel campus. The currently un-maintained pathway from LH to the new library will be transformed into a well-landscaped garden paved road. Future plans include closing the 12th mile - Kattangal road, aiming to create a one-entry, one-exit campus for enhanced security and traffic management. Issues faced by CPAS The Dean of Student Welfare (DSW) will schedule a meeting with the Centre for Career Development (CCD) team to discuss and address concerns related to career and placement-related activities. PG + PhD Stipend Delay: Acknowledging the delay in PG and PhD stipends, it was decided that the Director will personally discuss this matter with the Dean of Academics to expedite the resolution of the delay. Tathva/Ragam Proshow The director was reluctant to give permission for a large-scale pro-show for TATHVA but was in favour of conducting small-scale musical events for TATHVA given that the organizers follow strict protocols. The director suggested that more opportunities should be given to the students of the institute during RAGAM & TATHVA. He encouraged the initiative to have inter-NIT cultural events as part of RAGAM.

CPAS: REX is considered as a backlog by the institute during placement, whereas in other colleges REX examination is not considered as a backlog during internship and placement drives. The lack of coordination between the CCD and students was given to the notice of DSW. As of now, students' problems cannot be properly expressed to the CCD. There is no awareness about overloading, some companies look for 6-month compulsory internships and students who have not overloaded are denied the opportunity to go for these companies. UG AAS raised the issue of insufficient study space in the main campus during the exam week and was instructed to submit a request by DSW. The need to raise the menstrual leave from the current 2% to 5% was raised. Request for Wi-Fi routers for C hostel and library were submitted by CNC to Dean PnD and is waiting for his approval.

      "content": "NITC/SAC2021/SPO/05 Dated: 09/01/2022 Minutes of SAC EM-01 (09/01/2022) A SAC Emergency Meeting was conducted on 09th January 2022, at 11:00 am IST, with the sole agenda of Campus Rejoin. The queries raised were as follows: What is the count of cases on campus? There are 13-14 cases, but these students were detected during the institutional quarantine and moved to the International Hostel. If any students want to get tested, don't hesitate to contact your SAC Councillor. What is the treatment given to the Covid patients? Once they have tested positive, the students are moved to IH. The Hostel itself bears the student's quarantine expenses (medicine and such). The students will only have to pay for the PCR and the food (a nutritious diet) Can international students be quarantined in hostels for a week? Yes, these students can quarantine in the hostels for a week. An RT-PCR test will be taken on the 8th day, and they can upload it wherever necessary. Are there restrictions to travel out of the campus? The restrictions were relaxed as per the student's demand earlier. So far, there aren't any restrictions to go out once they have gotten permission. The students are advised not to leave the campus unless required. The restrictions can be made even more stringent if deemed necessary. Will the students be asked to return to campus if there is a lockdown? It depends on the situation and can't be guaranteed. Students can be accommodated on campus, but the restrictions will be stricter. Students travelling from places with lockdown can receive permission from the Director to travel to the campus. What protocol do primary contacts have to follow? The primary contacts need to self-monitor and inform the concerned people if they show any symptoms. Requests to be put forth: B20 Councillors requested provisions to accommodate B20s who have already booked their tickets. HAS has informed that provisions for these students can be discussed. A request to make the entry window for M21 more flexible were raised. Suggestions : Students who leave the campus can be quarantined for a day. A hybrid model of education was put forth by the councillors. A survey for the opinion of the students will be released. Random Testing should be done. A private agency to set up a testing facility on campus. A detailed guideline for the Covid Protocols should be made. A monitoring system for students who are tested Leave relaxations to be made available for students who test positive. (Especially for PG-PhD students who have stipend) Other: Stipend for PG students as they have to pay the hostel fees and such. Internet Facilities on Campus. a request for a private network was put forth by the HODs for placements and interviews. TnP has a private network. Students who face network issues during interviews and such can put forth a request for the same classrooms will be provided with internet facilities, and students who have network issues for academic purposes. Students are reminded to follow the covid protocols and not leave the campus unless necessary. Any further changes or updates will be informed by the administration.

The minutes along with the voter’s list, are attached below. Warm Regards, Sanath Santhosh Albin P James Speaker Deputy Speaker 1. Announcements The meeting started with the Speaker presenting remarks on the attendance and participation of the SAC Councillors in the Emergency Meeting held the day before. The B21 SAC councillors have been added to the council, and they were also present during the meeting. The meeting then proceeded with the report of the Executives and their Councils. 2. Reports Joint Secretary Pedals Go was contacted to have electric cycles to move around the campus. However, they need at least 1500 active students to test the product; hence the testing process will be conducted in the following semester. Bus Services will be continued from the next month.

A new court for Kabaddi and Kho Kho will be introduced. A new high jump and long jump pit has also been pipelined. The renovation of the 12th Mile ground is taking place.

Proposal for the renovation of Creative Zone (CZ) was taken up. Database collection of alumni is under process. The Student Alumni Cell is re-initiated. 3. Transactions 3.1 Even Semester Elections Then, we had started with the first transaction in the agenda, the proposal for an even semester election. The proposal was presented by the Speaker, and the councillors were asked to debate it. The main discussion revolved around NOTA and having the final year students in the electorate. NOTA: The proposal for having NOTA was introduced to have a sense of accountability for the EC candidates even if they are standing as a single nomination. Even if 10-15% of the students vote for NOTA, the EC member can reflect on their policies and make necessary changes. The Councillors asked if re-election would happen if NOTA won. If it didn’t happen, they argued that NOTA would sow a seed of disbelief among the GSB, and it could negatively impact the EC member and the attitude of the GSB to the position. Final Years in the electorate: If the even semester election comes to be, a student would only be able to vote a year less than their academic year. i.e. (a B. Tech student would only be able to vote for three years, and a PG student would only be able to vote for one year ). However, a few councillors pointed out that the final years would be passing out and that they would be voting for EC members that wouldn’t represent them. The rebuttal to this was that they would have issues such are the grade-cards graduation certificate that concerns the next EC. Since the members couldn’t come to a conclusion for the above topics, they were excluded from the proposal. The 4th year EP councillor had proposed an introduction of the Rank Voting System. Further discussions regarding the same need to be done it the coming SAC Meetings. 3.2 Change in EC duties. The following transaction on the agenda was the Change in EC duties. The proposal was to keep a separate the Ragam Convenor from the CAS and the Tathva Convenor from the TAS from here forth to reduce the burden of the Executives. The above proposal was even recommended by the DSW office. The councillors requested for the formation of a sub-committee for setting a basic guideline that can be followed so that the CAS and TAS can choose nominee’s that fit the basic requirements. 3.3 Social Welfare Committee. The following agenda was the establishment of the Social Welfare Committee. The GS and JS had requested for the formation of a sub-committee with them and a team that can present a report and proposal for the same. 3.4 Scholarship Help Desk. The next item on the agenda was the Scholarship Help Desk. The GS and the JS had requested the SAC councillors to find out one student from each scholarship so that the documentation process can be catalogued and presented to the students in the upcoming batch. A sub-committee for the same will be formed. 4. Voting Once the above points in the agenda were discussed, the meeting was adjourned, and the voting for the proposal of the Even Semester election and the Changes in the EC duties took place. Since the above proposals were constitutional amendments, the voting was as follows: The vote shall be considered valid only if at least two-thirds of the total current strength of SAC votes on the proposal. The proposed amendment shall be treated as passed only if at least two-third of the votes is in favour of the amendment. The Voter’s List for the amendment is attached towards the end of the document. The Results of the Proposals are as follows Hence both the amendments have been passed and will be presented to the DSW office. If students are not satisfied with the above amendments, then: If at least 10% members of the GSB make a signed request to the Speaker within 15 days of the announcement of the decision to reconsider the decision, the Speaker shall convene an RM for this purpose.

      "content": "For They have the right to vote as they are still in college. irrespective of first or last year. Recent graduates would need communication.. and freshers would be working with them for the whole time Final years have a clear idea regarding the candidates The duration of the program should match the number of votes. Eg: PG is a normally 2-year program, but if final years are not allowed to vote will only get 1 vote. Voting should constitute the complete strength of the GSB. The final years know more than anyone else about the college and they can truly judge how far the manifestos of the candidates can be correct and how many things in the manifestos can truly be implemented. Against They will graduate out of college and hence the elected EC members would represent them hence they needn’t be added to the electorate An election by definition is a process in which people elect representatives to represent them and voice their concerns. So giving the 4th year voting rights violates the basic principles of the election. They are voting for some people to represent the other batches of the institute after they pass out of the college and this whole idea doesn't make sense. How can we expect final years to have a clear idea about the candidates? Mostly in an elections winners must be chosen based on the manifestos and also by judging how effectively the candidates can interact with the students and get their ideas and concerns get voiced to the institute. Either being a final year or first year, way of assessing a candidate is uniform and final years having a better experience doesn't make sense. It is just like saying old people in an electorate have more experience and their choice will be the best. Phase 2 of the elections is the BR elections and final years dont have even a role in it since they dont need anyone to represent them anymore. The same thing should also be applied for the phase 1 elections. The basic idea is just the same Retrieved from ‘https://wiki.fosscell.org/index.php?title=Final_Years_in_the_Electorate_SAC_2021-22&oldid=617’",

      "url": "https://wiki.fosscell.org/index.php?oldid=652",
      "content": "Students Affairs Council NIT Calicut 2 April 2014 Chairman Board Of Academic Council (BOAC) NIT Calicut Sir, Sub : Request for revival of rules in the present Academic System Increase maximum duration of course to 8 years for students with reservation. Also kindly permit all students to avail two continuous probations as with that they will be able to complete their course within the duration permitted (i.e.; 6 years at present).(R 9.0 of 2012 rules and R 11.0 of 2010 rules).Most of the other NITs have this in their rules and regulations. Summer term was abolished after 2011 and supplementary examinations were introduced. But the passing rate for supplementary is very less compared to summer term. So we request for a re-introduction of Summer term not just for first years but for all courses in the curriculum were the number of failures for the course exceeds 35.Subjects like Mathematics - 1, Mathematics - 2, Mathematics - 3 and Mathematics - 4 need to be specially mentioned and are the courses with most failures. During this monsoon semester, the third level course ME3002 Principles of Heat Transfer had more than 50 failures and kindly consider this as a very special case. R 8.1 c of 2012 ordinances and regulations state that a student should complete all courses till second level (1st,2nd,3rd and 4th semester) for entering into his fourth level(7th semester). Many students who have cleared all third level courses but have courses in second level will be under probation as per this rule.But as already there is a limitation on the number of credits to be registered in a semester i.e.; 28 credits for 7th and 8th semesters and 24 for lower semesters.(R 7.0 of 2012 rules),it would be really beneficial for the students if this rule could be removed, so that many of the students can complete their course without undergoing probation. At the start of the year a one time relaxation of this rule was provided and most of the students are in a state of completing their courses without losing an year. As our students are not familiar with industries in a practical level, an internship or an industrial visit for at least a month can be made a compulsory one credit course with presentation regarding the visit to be made in 8th semester. This visit can be made during the summer vacations. If faculties can help in arranging these internships it would be really be helpful for the students. The current system of CGPA conversion into percentage has several shortcomings and so we request for a change. The conversion formula proposed is as given below Percentage = CGPA * 10 . All other NITs either follow this formula or have no such conversion formulas. Students here do not get a chance to apply for several companies due to this, as most of the firms fix the cutoff in percentages. Hope you will favorably consider our request and act in the favor of students of NIT Calicut . Thank you.

Request for LAN in Mega Hostels: Request was put forward for LAN facility in Mega Boys Hostel. /* I’m not sure what he said about this */ Request to change the CGPA conversion formula: Request was given to change the current CGPA conversion formula. The current formula deducts .5 from the cgpa and multiplies it by 10 to get percentage marks. It was proposed that the deduction of .5 be removed and that cgpa be directly multiplied by 10. But it was not considered as the most other NITs follow the formula that is currently used. Request to add more faculties in the Training and Placement cell :The training and placement cell is managed by a single Faculty and a peon currently. It was proposed that more faculties may be put under the cell so as to make its working more efficient. The matter will be discussed with Suresh Babu Sir the following day . Sports Issues in general Mechanism to complaint against faculty and to make teacher evaluation more effective It was pointed out that, though there is a system to evaluate the faculties, proper follow up is not done which leaves the whole process without any result. Web site and DSS /*dont remember*/ Bus service for first year girls Request for NITC bus to be used for the proposed bus service between new lecture hall complex and Ladies Hostel during lunch hours was put forward. Request to improve Ambulance and other medical facilities The poor condition of the ambulance and lack of proper medical facilities were mentioned. It was assured that due importance would be given to the issue and proper action would be taken to improve them. Wifi facility to be availed in hostels Due to the huge size of mega ladies hostel, It is impossible to facilitate room to room LAN as it may cause inconvenience to cleaning staff and the speed will also be less.

As the cricket coach has resigned, a new coach can be appointed once a no dues of the previous coach is submitted to Dean(SW) Additionally it was requested that some teams have not yet got a coach. Teams that need coach: badminton, tennis, kabaddi and hockey. Handball team requested for a parallel court with hockey ground. They also requested for a goal post. Physical Education dept. faculty suggested interlocking mat for badminton, tennis and kabaddi. This was kept as a long term objective by the meeting. The meeting was informed that purchase of equipment for gymkhana is delayed because of complaints and protests. These equipments were described as 16 single station for separate muscle development. The meeting suggested to go ahead with special committee evaluation and purchase. Table tennis team requested for a barricade in the auditorium. The Faculty incharge of physical education dept. mentioned the attempt to convert the old post office into table tennis center. This was found to be a good idea by the meeting and supports this attempt. Basketball team mentioned the following: 2nd court is not finished properly. only 3 lights are working out of 8. The engineering department said that they cannot repair the lighting system since it was not installed by them. It has to be done by the physical education department. Dean(P&D) suggested to get help to replace/move lights from other places and get electrical EU help for the same. A sports calendar has to be made and dates for team selections has to be fixed. A decision regarding annual sports day to be conducted during a weekend of monsoon semester was taken. This was because the meeting felt that there is no point of conducting a sports meet after inter-NIT. Badminton team captain mentioned the issue of the slippery courts and suggested painting them with gum paints to avoid injuries and also the issue of roof height. Cricket captain raised the issue of poor maintenance of cricket pitch and the reluctance of the workers to do maintenance work due to some payment issues. It was also mentioned that the cricket team is currently practicing on the concrete pitches. Half mat was requested. This is already available in the store and was promised to be given from practice.

      "content": "INTERIM SAC REPORT The following is the report regarding activities undertaken by Interim SAC during its tenure from --------- to -------- Online fee payment portal for Institute Fees and Hostel Fees In order to avoid the rush during registration, Interim SAC requested that payment of institute fees and hostel dues be facilitated through SBI Collect so as to make the registration process fast as well as less hectic for the students. As an extension of the same, the Hostel Office continue to use SBI Collect and this has made the monthly mess due remission easier. Beautification of Quadrangle between MB and DB The Interim SAC gave request including an architectural plan to Dean(Student’s Welfare) concerning the beautification of the MB-DB quadrangle on 6th June. This was approved by the concerned authorities and the work of the same will be starting in December. Road Safety within Campus In light of some unfortunate incidents that occurred during the previous years, Interim SAC raised the issue of road safety inside campus. As a result of the same many actions were taken which include installation of speed breakers at most needed areas. Water Quality Assurance Among one of the first issue raised by the Interim SAC was the quality and availability of water inside campus. As a result of the same all water tanks were checked and cleaned on ………………… Drinking water was not available in various locations in the campus, viz East Campus, Mega Hostel and Health Centre. Additionally, some of the existing water purifiers were malfunctioning. New purifiers were installed in various locations like Mega Men’s Hostel and all the existing purifiers were checked and filters were replaced. As an extension to this, the 1st cycle of quality assurance was conducted during mid-October. Issues regarding Mega Boys Hostel (LAN and Mess) Even though the Mega (boys) hostel has been opened for the students for the past one year, the Mega Boys’ Hostel premises was far from inhabitable. Some of the problems faced by the inmates of the hostel were :- No permanent mess facility in or near the hostel. No Lift facility No internet connectivity Upon request of the Interim SAC, the following actions were taken : The International Hostel Mess was renovated and refurnished in order to accommodate the inmates of Mega Hostel Lift facility has been started during rush hours LAN connectivity to Mega Hostels has been approved and will be implemented before November 20th Medical Insurance for Students The existed medical insurance plan contained only Rs. 35,000 as medical claim and Rs. 1,00,000 in case of an accident. The new plan introduced because of the efforts of Interim SAC contains Rs. 1,00,000 as medical claim, Rs. 3,00,000 incase of an accident and newly added Rs. *3,00,000 incase of death of the sole earning member of the student’s family and Rs 10,00,000 incase of an accidental death. Students coming from a financially weak backgrounds have been given a relaxation in same. Safety in Hostels Waste Disposal (Setting up of Dust Bins) There had been many complaints regarding the waste management system existing in the campus. As per the proposal put forward by Interim SAC, 700 color-coded dustbins had been purchased and will be installed before 25th October. Extermination of Stray Dogs The immediate and prompt intervention of interim SAC in the matter of stray dogs loitering the campus, which had become a very serious and threatful menace in the recent past, took immediate effect with the capture of 75 dogs within two months. With the exponential decrease in the number of dogs in the campus, threat to student safety has been minimized. Regular inspections continue to prevail in this regard. Poor lighting of Volleyball and Basketball courts Consistent efforts from the Interim SAC has beared fruit with the approval of permanent floodlights and lighting support systems. Purchase order is underway and project is scheduled for completion by Probation As we all know, there are rules and criteria regulating registration of students to subsequent semesters. Students not able to abide by these are bound to leave the college and inturn their educational degree. But there are several individual cases Fee hike According to MHRD Guidelines provided on 1st July, a 100% fee hike was to be implemented. Interim SAC immediately took actions regarding the issue and requested the Director to withhold such actions. The issue was raised with MHRD legally and otherwise. Interim SAC also contacted several institutions like NIT Pondicherry who had already paid the increased fees and co ordinated a movement against the same. An appointment was obtained to meet Minister of Human Resource Development and the issue was resolved before 24th July. Formation of Official Cultural Team There was no organized official cultural team in the Institute and it was a disappointment to students with such inclinations. Interim SAC took initiative to organize such a body and NITC cultural team was formed. Interim SAC would like to congratulate all the team members on their terrific performance in TKM, Kollam.

      "content": "Memorandum Submitted to Hon. Minister, MHRD Respected Sir/Madam, SUBJECT: REQUEST TO REVOKE THE NEW FEE STRUCTURE FOR B-Tech COURSE AT National Institute of Technology, Calicut(NITC), Kerala. The Students Affairs Council of NIT Calicut, is writing this letter on behalf of all the students of NIT Calicut with reference to the notice issued by the MHRD dated 1st July 2014 with reference number No.F.33-4/2014-TS.lll . The tuition fee of B-Tech students at NITs all over the country has been doubled, with effect from the coming semester. This has caused great anxiety and an unbelievable amount of stress and presents itself as a tragic financial blow to a large group of B-Tech students (over 4500), as well as their parents,of our institute. Our current tuition fee sums up to a total of ------- annually. As per the new notice, it sums up to a staggering amount of --------. We would like to bring to your kind attention that our college is home to students from all social and economic backgrounds with financial constraints. Knowledge is wealth they say. But will the price they pay for this wealth destroy the dreams and hopes of parents and students? Such an impulsive form of fee incrementation, in such a reputed college aided by the National Government comes as tragic and unbearable news to a lot of financially backward families whose hopes rests on their ward. It is a matter of pride for every parent to have their child admitted in the NIT for obvious reasons, but such a pride should not come at a price that is uncalled for or simply not affordable. For years, every middle or lower class Indian family abides by a certain financial setup, to make ends meet at the end of every month. Many will have to depend on banks, moneylenders and pawnbrokers to pay the already existing amount. A hasty and unnecessary increase of fees will just add to the misery. The financial estimate at the time of admission will be totally dismantled. A second year student, at the time of passing out, will have to pay an estimated amount of 1,30,000 in excess due to this new fee hike. Such an amount is a huge sum for the son of a farmer or a small vendor. As a reason, some of the brightest minds of the Nation will have to drop out from the college as they simply cannot afford to pay for the their dreams. In most other NITs except NIT Calicut, classes have already commenced and the hike in fees, if implemented, will only have to be paid eventually. The registration for our successive semester will happen ten days from now. None of the parents have yet been informed about the possible increase in fees. This will come as a shock to many parents, as they will have to arrange the excess amount within the specified date, especially if they have more than one child studying in the NIT. If they fail to do so, the registration of their ward will remain cancelled and they will, in turn, lose a year of their life. Such a course of action taking place in the life of a student who managed to get into one of the top colleges in the country is simply tragic. On such short notice, it would be impossible for most parents to raise the hiked amount. Banks do not bend the loan schemes to accommodate revisal of fee structure.Scholarships have not been upgraded to support the newly proposed fee plan. Such a gigantic increase in the fees would leave every parent confused with nowhere to run for money. The very concept of Nationally significant institutes endorsed by the government was that every talented mind could afford a world class education .NITs boast of being the pride of the country, having the cream of the country’s minds. This demand could cause a migration of brilliant students in the coming years to other government colleges of equally good academic progress that would give them a promising future without having to burden their parents with the hefty price tag that comes with such a form of quality education. This will bring down the standards of our college by leaps and bounds. On such grounds, the effects of doubling the tuition fees would only tarnish the reputation of our college and destroy the dreams of many bright minds throughout the nation. We hope you will sympathise with us on this situation and look into the matter at the earliest for proper urgent changes and revive us form such cruel rules. We strongly insist that this absurd new change be undone and the fee revision be cancelled with immediate effect, taking our apprehensions into consideration. Hoping for a favourable action from your end. Thanking you WRITE UP FOR SAC PAGE AGAINST FEES HIKE This notice is to bring to light the recent decision of the Union MHRD to double the fees at all NIT institutes across the country. According to this new order, No. F.33-4/2014-TS.III, dated May 5th, 2014 all NIT’s are allowed a monstrous and irrational 100 % fee hike which is applied to all existing and future students of these institutions. The new fees hike is undesirable for a number of reasons including family background of students, quality of education and facilities provided. First of all it seems quite unfair that the existing students, who only have a limited time left at the college, also have to pay the newly improvised fees. These students will not be able to reap the so called benefits of the supplementary fees. This sudden increase in fees for existing students will not only be an extended load on our families, but will also hinder any financial planning that was done prior to the course. Also many amongst us come from economically weaker backgrounds and have signed up for educational loans, which now becomes even more difficult to pay off. When a similar fees hike was introduced in the IIT’s two years back, it wasn’t made applicable to the existing batch of students. This seemingly unfair bias amongst institutes of national importance further calls upon the need for us, the students, to ask for revised rules for the fees hike. All students also need to understand that this decision was solely undertaken by the MHRD and the institutions themselves have no direct say in this matter. A few of the NIT’s have already implemented this new order much to the remorse and shock of parents and students alike. We, as the students of NIT-C, need to ensure that the same fate does not befall us. Actions have already been undertaken by the SAC to ensure that our voices are heard and that the order isrevoked. A meeting of the interim SAC with the Director was convened on the 18th of July. The director and the registrar patiently listened to our difficulties and informed us that they were already aware of the same and are helpless with regard to undoing the order. The minutes of the meeting are attached below. Therefore it is our duty to ensure that we inform the MHRD about how cheated we feel and the only way we can do this is to raise awareness amongst ourselves and our other friends who are studying at other NIT’s across the country. Remember that, we are not asking the MHRD for a favor, but are demanding something which is practically and rationally justified. Meanwhile the SAC will continue its efforts and hope that you do the same. Simple Letter (Not to be used ) (for reference only ) July 20, 2014 The Director Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Human resource Development, Shastri Bhawan, New Delhi – 110001. Sir, Sub.: Issue regarding the fee hike brought about in NITs. In response to circular F .No.33 - 4/ 2014- TS.III, we write this letter o address the grievance of the student community of NITC. Since the circular issued recommending the fee hike for the general category students has brought about anxiety among students, we would like to bring to your notice this injustice against students. The news that the government has decided to double the tuition fees from around 35,000 to 70,000 per annum from the coming academic session has led to resentment among both students and parents. When there have been no additional facilities provided to the students or improvements made in the infrastructure, the reason for fee hike remains obscure. There have been earlier issues regarding the infrastructural facilities being offered at NITC as there had been an unfortunate incident where the poor construction of a wall in campus had claimed a life. Having these earlier issues not addressed, another grievance has supplemented it. Being an institution of national importance, the student community of NITC expects well furnished labs and infrastructure. Earlier it was a common aspiration of students to study with less tuition fees from government engineering colleges like IITs and NITs, whereas now this aspiration has become a bit more expensive. A 100% hike is an alarming increase as it is not a small amount to common man. Together with the increasing everyday expenses a hike as large as this is a burden to middle class families. It also raises concern among those students availing educational loans to pursue engineering as their pre approved loan instalments will be adversely impacted. If the decision to revise fees for PhD programmes was to encourage engineers to go for research work, then there should be also encouragement for students to take up engineering in national institutes in the first place. We expect the concerned authorities to look into the above mentioned issues as soon as possible and recede the circular which brought the fee hike in effect. Thanking You. Yours Sincerely, .

      "content": "The Right Way (Fortnightly edition) Introduction– ‘The Right Way’ was conceived by the students of our college as a newsletter for all. All prestigious universities around the world have their own newsletter which serves to inform students and faculty equally. Through the establishment of our own newsletter, we would not only join these ranks but serve to deliver to the student community a go to place for all the information relevant to their college life – both educational and extra-curricular. History of College Newsletters – The Ivy leagues have long been famous for their tradition and quality of their education. Amongst the throng of famous college publications Harvard Crimson, Cornell Daily Sun and The Tech (MIT) stand out. In particular we will consider the case of Harvard Crimson which has been successfully run from 1873. The Harvard Crimson was founded during the period of the Civil War to inform the campus of issues of local and national importance in a student friendly manner. The Harvard Crimson which started out as a fortnightly publication has evolved into a daily newspaper. Many of Crimson editors have covered monumental events such as World wars; freedom struggles etc. and has gone on to win Pulitzer prizes in journalism. Notable newsletters are also run by college such as IIT-Kharagpur and IIT-Madras. The need for ‘The Right Way’ in NIT-C – The current scenario in our college is one of plain ‘ignorance’. We need a newspaper to ensure that issues of technological and social importance reach the students. On an initial set-up scale, these are the columns that we plan to include in ‘The Right Way’:- Campus Voice – A student’s perspective on matters of national and campus importance. There will not be any limitation on the material. The matter will also include latest NIT-C sports, arts and academic news. It can be presented in either written or visual form. Tech Buzz – Tech Buzz will bring together latest innovations in engineering to the student community. There will be representation from all branches of engineering in our college and associations with branch communities like MEA, ECEA etc. NIT-C Market – This will be a go to place for the students where they can advertise personal objects for sale. For example – Bicycles, books etc. This form of advertising can also generate small revenue for the newspaper which can later be fuelled towards funding or social purposes. The Looking Glass – This segment of the newspaper will deal with international issues and their impacts on our lives. This will also provide facts of latest economic trends and most importantly will provide information on foreign universities, their pre-requirements and courses offered. The Training and Placement Corner – This segment will provide latest employment opportunities and tips for the students to prepare for interviews. It can also provide relevant dates of interviews and sessions. Faculty Bowl – This column will give the faculty a platform to address the students on both on technical and non-technical issues. Satyr – This is the multi-lingual column of the newspaper through which students can express their creativity through the written word. Submissions can be made to the committee and the best two will be posted in the newspaper. It will feature both fiction and non-fiction publications. Popcorn – This will be the column for providing latest film reviews to the students. It will also give movie suggestions and latest entertainment news. Comix – Latest student comics will be given a platform through this column. Other famous comic strips may also be included for light reading. The scope of other columns is limitless and can be introduced on a need basis as the newspaper progresses. Organizational Structure – Core Committee – Faculty Editor, Student Editor, 8 creators and 5 photographers. Extended Committee – 12 members distributed between content creators and photographers The Faculty and Student editors will hold the decision making powers for the newspaper while the other members will all report to them at meetings fixed at the committee’s will. Physical Requirements– ‘The Right Way’ will require a single room to be allocated to them under the guidance and permission of the SAC to conduct its data collection and newspaper design. All printing will be done externally away from the campus. Monetary Requirements – All discussions on cost of operation can be decided and set upon by the SAC.

Considering the present scenario, the ways to pay dues are limited and tiresome for the students. Also, most of the students will reach only on or a day before registration, making them wait in long queues in front of the ATMs to pay off their dues which in turn delays the registration process and makes it hectic for the students. There are also chances of ATMs getting stuck which may worsen the situation. So we, the Interim SAC, request you to facilitate payment of hostel dues through SBI Collect as to make the registration process fast as well as less hectic for the students. Thanking You.

      "content": "National Institute Of Technology ,Calicut National Institute of Technology Calicut (NIT Calicut or NITC), formerly Regional Engineering College Calicut, is a public technical university and an institute of national importance governed by the NIT Act passed by the Parliament of India. The campus is situated 22 kilometres (14 mi) north east of Kozhikode, on the Kozhikode–Mukkam Road. It was established in 1961 and was known as Calicut Regional Engineering College (CREC) until 2002. It is one of the National Institutes of Technology campuses established by the Government of India for imparting high standard technical education to students from all over the country. NIT Calicut hosts a supercomputer on its campus,[6] and has a dedicated nanotechnology department. History Intial Years: National Institute of Technology, Calicut was set up in 1961 as Regional Engineering College Calicut (CREC), the ninth of its kind and the first one to be established during the Third Five-Year Plan period. Until the formation of Calicut University in 1963, the institute was affiliated with Kerala University. It was largely due to the efforts of Pattom Thanu Pillai, then Chief Minister of Kerala, that the institute came into being. Prof. S. Rajaraman, first principal of Government Engineering College, Thrissur was appointed as the special officer in 1961 to organise the activities of the college until M. V. Kesava Rao took charge as the first principal of the college. The classes were initially held at the Government Polytechnic at West Hill, before it moved to its present campus in 1963. The college started with an annual intake of 125 students for the undergraduate courses, on a campus of 120 hectares (1.2 km2; 300 acres). Expansion The undergraduate courses' intake increased to 250 in 1966, 150 for the first year, and 100 for the preparatory course. The annual intake was reduced from 250 to 200 from the year 1968–69 on account of the industrial recession. After Prof S. Unnikrishnan Pillai took charge as principal in 1983, the Training and Placement Department was started to organise campus recruitments for students. The college moved into the area of information technology in 1984 with the commissioning of multi-user PSI Omni system and HCL workhorse PCs. In 1987 the college celebrated 25 years of its existence, and postgraduate courses were started. The CEDTI was established on the campus the following year. In 1990 Shankar Dayal Sharma inaugurated the Architecture Department Block and construction of a computer centre was completed. In 1996, the institute website (the first in Kerala) was launched. The Indian Institute of Management Calicut functioned from the NIT campus in its first few years of existence before moving to its new campus in Kunnamangalam in 2003. The Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, accorded NIT status to REC Calicut in June 2002 granting it academic and administrative autonomy. It was a lead institute under the World Bank-funded Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP) which began in 2002. In 2003, students were first admitted to the flagship undergraduate B.Tech through the All India Engineering Entrance Exam. With the passing of the National Institutes of Technology Act in May 2007, NIT Calicut was declared an Institute of National Importance.[8] The National Institutes of Technology Act is the second legislation for technical education institutions after the Indian Institutes of Technology Act of 1961. In 2007 NIT Calicut raised its annual intake for its undergraduate programme to 570.[9] The annual intake for the undergraduate programme was increased to 1049 by 2011.

      "content": "The committee members proposes the following points for consideration. First priority is to request all the faculty members to complete the course content through online mode / any other content delivery method, by the end of May. The committee feels that the chances of having a window to conduct the classes on campus are very meagre. Faculty members may adopt appropriate methods for teaching the contents to the students. Assignments and Quizzes may also be completed during this time. There may be difficulties for few students to be part of this process. The institute may provide facilities for such students as a separate session as and when the situation permits. These students will not be denied an opportunity for learning / evaluation, however, they may go through a delayed process. The departments may ensure speedy project evaluations and ensure that all the requirements for the award of the degree for the graduating batch are completed within the specified time-frame. Secondly, inform the students about the reporting date (i) as the date declared by GoI if social distancing is not there and (ii) as per table below in case social distancing is a must. PhD’s in first/second semester and in their final stage as decided by their supervisor , 2nd year PG, 3rd year MCA, S8 BTech and S10 B Arch(Group 1) 1st day of reopening. S6 BTech, S8 BArch, 2nd year MCA, 1st year PG(Group 2) 15 days after reopening. S4 BTech, S6 BArch, 1st year MCA(Group 3) 25 days after reopening. S2 BTech, S4 BArch, S2 BArch and all other PhD students (Group 4) 35 days after reopening. In case the State government insists for 14 days of quarantine for student traveling from other places, the following schedule may be adopted. PhD’s in first/second semester and in their final stage as decided by their supervisor , 2nd year PG, 3rd year MCA, S8 BTech and S10 B Arch(Group 1) Reports on 1st day of reopening. 14 days quarantine+ 15days to complete academic schedule S6 BTech, S8 BArch, 2nd year MCA, 1st year PG(Group 2) Reports 30 days after reopening. 14 days quarantine+ 10 days to complete academic schedule S4 BTech, S6 BArch, 1st year MCA(Group 3) Reports 55 days after reopening. 14 days quarantine+ 10 days to complete academic schedule S2 BTech, S4 BArch, S2 BArch and all other PhD students (Group 4) Reports 80 days after reopening. To ensure maximum social distancing in the campus, the students can be accommodated in the institute as per table above and course of action for the current semester is planned as detailed below and in the flowchart. The restrictions on stay / dining / lab work can be effectively implemented by the above strategy. In case there are course overlaps between students of these groups (especially between Groups 1 and 2 / Groups 3 and 4), the faculty may conduct separate evaluations. The maximum number of students expected in each group are (i) Group 1 – 1650 (ii) Group 2- 1500 (iii) Group 3- 1400 and (iv) Group 4- 1650. Maximum number of days required on campus for each of these groups for completing the evaluations of this semester is 15 (for final year)/10 days for each group. Hence once the reopening date is decided based on directives from GoI/ MHRD (assuming that social distancing is mandatory) the exact schedule can be prepared easily and communicated to the students. If the reopening of the institute is delayed beyond the first week of June 2020, the possibility of accommodating Group 2 students with Group 1 students can be considered. This will ensure that the internship / placement plans of the pre-final years are not affected. Similarly Group 3 and Group 4 students can be combined so that they need not proceed to their homes after their exams. The flow chart given below explains the course of action. In the event of a worst case scenario wherein some or all of our final year students cannot reach campus in person, we may have to decide on the possibility of conducting the final examinations completely online (with possible viva voce examinations). Necessary modifications to the already approved evaluation policy (weights for mid-semester / assignments / end-semester) can be thought of, if we are required to proceed with a fully online end semester examination.

      "content": "National Institute Of Technology ,Calicut National Institute of Technology Calicut (NIT Calicut or NITC), formerly Regional Engineering College Calicut, is a public technical university and an institute of national importance governed by the NIT Act passed by the Parliament of India. The campus is situated 22 kilometres (14 mi) north east of Kozhikode, on the Kozhikode–Mukkam Road. It was established in 1961 and was known as Calicut Regional Engineering College (CREC) until 2002. It is one of the National Institutes of Technology campuses established by the Government of India for imparting high standard technical education to students from all over the country. NIT Calicut hosts a supercomputer on its campus,[6] and has a dedicated nanotechnology department. History Intial Years: National Institute of Technology, Calicut was set up in 1961 as Regional Engineering College Calicut (CREC), the ninth of its kind and the first one to be established during the Third Five-Year Plan period. Until the formation of Calicut University in 1963, the institute was affiliated with Kerala University. It was largely due to the efforts of Pattom Thanu Pillai, then Chief Minister of Kerala, that the institute came into being. Prof. S. Rajaraman, first principal of Government Engineering College, Thrissur was appointed as the special officer in 1961 to organise the activities of the college until M. V. Kesava Rao took charge as the first principal of the college. The classes were initially held at the Government Polytechnic at West Hill, before it moved to its present campus in 1963. The college started with an annual intake of 125 students for the undergraduate courses, on a campus of 120 hectares (1.2 km2; 300 acres). Expansion The undergraduate courses' intake increased to 250 in 1966, 150 for the first year, and 100 for the preparatory course. The annual intake was reduced from 250 to 200 from the year 1968–69 on account of the industrial recession. After Prof S. Unnikrishnan Pillai took charge as principal in 1983, the Training and Placement Department was started to organise campus recruitments for students. The college moved into the area of information technology in 1984 with the commissioning of multi-user PSI Omni system and HCL workhorse PCs. In 1987 the college celebrated 25 years of its existence, and postgraduate courses were started. The CEDTI was established on the campus the following year. In 1990 Shankar Dayal Sharma inaugurated the Architecture Department Block and construction of a computer centre was completed. In 1996, the institute website (the first in Kerala) was launched. The Indian Institute of Management Calicut functioned from the NIT campus in its first few years of existence before moving to its new campus in Kunnamangalam in 2003. The Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, accorded NIT status to REC Calicut in June 2002 granting it academic and administrative autonomy. It was a lead institute under the World Bank-funded Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP) which began in 2002. In 2003, students were first admitted to the flagship undergraduate B.Tech through the All India Engineering Entrance Exam. With the passing of the National Institutes of Technology Act in May 2007, NIT Calicut was declared an Institute of National Importance.[8] The National Institutes of Technology Act is the second legislation for technical education institutions after the Indian Institutes of Technology Act of 1961. In 2007 NIT Calicut raised its annual intake for its undergraduate programme to 570.[9] The annual intake for the undergraduate programme was increased to 1049 by 2011. Campus Hostels A and B hostels accommodate 1st-year B.Tech students. II-year and III-year B.Tech students are accommodated in the New Mega Hostel. G Hostel has been reallocated as a ladies' hostel, and female students enrolled in Ph.D. are staying in G hostel. Final year B.Tech students are accommodated in D, E, F, and PG-I hostels. M.Tech. and MCA students reside in apartments. Men's Hostel A hostel B Hostel C hostel D hostel E hostel F hostel PG I PG II IH Mega Hostel MBA Hostel Women's Hostel LH block-1 LH block-2 LH block-3 LH block-4 Mega Ladies Hostel(MLH) Mess Each hostel has its own mess, and students are allowed to join any hostel mess, except for A and B, which are exclusive for first-year students.

      "content": "National Institute of Technology Calicut (NITC) is one of the 31 institutions of national importance set up by an Act of Parliament namely the ‘National Institute of technology Act 2007’, and is fully funded by the Government of India. The mandate of the Institute is to provide higher technical education and conduct research in the various branches of Engineering, Science, Technology and Management. Originally established in 1961 as a Regional Engineering College (REC), it was transformed into a National Institute of Technology in 2002. The Institute offers bachelors, masters and doctoral degree programs in Engineering, Science, Technology and Management. With its proactive collaborations with a multitude of research organizations, academic institutions and industries, the institute has set a new style for its functioning under the NIT regime. Set in a picturesque landscape at the foothills of the Western Ghats, NIT Calicut is located about 22 kilometres north-east of Calicut city in the state of Kerala, India. It stretches over a length of about 1.5 kilometres along the Calicut-Mukkam road, extending over an area of approximately 120 hectares. Calicut, also known as Kozhikode, located in the Malabar region of Kerala State, found a place in world history with the discovery of a sea route to India in 1498 by the Portuguese navigator Vasco Da Gama. Basking in the idyllic setting of the Arabian Sea on the west and the proud peaks of the Wayanad hills on the east, Calicut is known for its serene beaches, lush green countryside, historic sites, calm backwaters, wildlife sanctuaries, rivers and waterfalls. Being a fully residential institution, the campus houses academic buildings, research labs, hostels, residences and other amenities among its infrastructure. The Institute is presently offering 11 UG programmes and 29 PG programmes including MBA. Doctoral level research has remarkably increased in recent times with a substantial increase in the volume of research papers and patents produced. Many transformations in academic institutions become imperative for embracing the changes that happen by the rule of the nature and also for absorbing the results of the pursuits of the humanity in the areas of knowledge and skill. The case of converting the premier Regional Engineering Colleges (RECs) to the new brand of institutions of national importance was with such a purpose. The enactment of the NIT Act in 2007 has fuelled the growth of the new line of institutions of national importance named as National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and are being built to improve the social equity in high quality education in science, technology, engineering and management. The primary purpose of national integration envisaged for the RECs has been upheld in the formation of NITs too, but a new focus of research was added to the mandate. Originally established in 1961 as a Regional Engineering College (REC), National Institute of Technology Calicut has begun its triumphant journey with a new spirit in 2002, with the new name and a fresh mandate. This had helped the institute in broadening the spectrum of services to the humanity; Institute now offers Bachelors, Masters and Doctoral degree programmes in Engineering, Science, Technology and Management. The region of Malabar that hosts the Institute is the northern part of the State of Kerala and is a destination for ecotourism. The region is fast developing and is vibrant in all spheres of human life; there is no smoke and choke of heavy industries. Local business, small scale industries and the overseas jobs of the local population combined with the revolutionary practices of land reforms have resulted in a uniform distribution of development across the region. Perhaps, the entire State of Kerala has the advantage of these enabling factors. This development has helped in removing the disparities between city and the rural region. The threat of global warming could not yet steal the natural beauty of the landscape. Anyone can enjoy this from the pinnacles of the hills that mark the undulating topography. Malabar is historically known for the spices and the trading with the Middle East. As an institution of higher education and research, NIT Calicut cannot alienate itself from this growth pattern but has taken the lead in the regional development through many proactive measures as a friend, philosopher and guide. Faculty is posed with many challenges because of the princely treatment the institution gets from the public. So, the infrastructure for testing, research and development is undergoing continuous improvement. Redefining the goals and putting thrust on socially relevant subjects has enabled the Institute to produce ready-to-employ graduates and the value added research outputs with sustained quality and excellence. Notwithstanding the challenges that get opened up in terms resource crunch, lukewarm industrial supports, the institute is marching ahead and has marked its position as the 23rd one among technical institutions and third in the area of architecture in the year 2020. Campus is catering to the 6500 strong student population with a variety of services and state of the art education. Our roadmap is to reach the top and work with the best in the class institutions that are globally well known. We believe that excellence is a journey and not a destination. Institute is indebted to the Government of India, Ministry of Education, Kerala State Government, the local administration, industries, funding agencies, alumni and all other stakeholders for the grand support in its march towards excellence.

The campus is situated 22 kilometres (14 mi) north east of Kozhikode, on the Kozhikode–Mukkam Road. It was established in 1961 and was known as Calicut Regional Engineering College (CREC) until 2002. It is one of the National Institutes of Technology campuses established by the Government of India for imparting high standard technical education to students from all over the country. NIT Calicut hosts a supercomputer on its campus,[6] and has a dedicated nanotechnology department. History Intial Years: National Institute of Technology, Calicut was set up in 1961 as Regional Engineering College Calicut (CREC), the ninth of its kind and the first one to be established during the Third Five-Year Plan period. Until the formation of Calicut University in 1963, the institute was affiliated with Kerala University. It was largely due to the efforts of Pattom Thanu Pillai, then Chief Minister of Kerala, that the institute came into being. Prof. S. Rajaraman, first principal of Government Engineering College, Thrissur was appointed as the special officer in 1961 to organise the activities of the college until M. V. Kesava Rao took charge as the first principal of the college. The classes were initially held at the Government Polytechnic at West Hill, before it moved to its present campus in 1963. The college started with an annual intake of 125 students for the undergraduate courses, on a campus of 120 hectares (1.2 km2; 300 acres). Expansion The undergraduate courses' intake increased to 250 in 1966, 150 for the first year, and 100 for the preparatory course. The annual intake was reduced from 250 to 200 from the year 1968–69 on account of the industrial recession. After Prof S. Unnikrishnan Pillai took charge as principal in 1983, the Training and Placement Department was started to organise campus recruitments for students. The college moved into the area of information technology in 1984 with the commissioning of multi-user PSI Omni system and HCL workhorse PCs. In 1987 the college celebrated 25 years of its existence, and postgraduate courses were started. The CEDTI was established on the campus the following year. In 1990 Shankar Dayal Sharma inaugurated the Architecture Department Block and construction of a computer centre was completed. In 1996, the institute website (the first in Kerala) was launched. The Indian Institute of Management Calicut functioned from the NIT campus in its first few years of existence before moving to its new campus in Kunnamangalam in 2003. The Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, accorded NIT status to REC Calicut in June 2002 granting it academic and administrative autonomy. It was a lead institute under the World Bank-funded Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP) which began in 2002. In 2003, students were first admitted to the flagship undergraduate B.Tech through the All India Engineering Entrance Exam. With the passing of the National Institutes of Technology Act in May 2007, NIT Calicut was declared an Institute of National Importance.[8] The National Institutes of Technology Act is the second legislation for technical education institutions after the Indian Institutes of Technology Act of 1961. In 2007 NIT Calicut raised its annual intake for its undergraduate programme to 570.[9] The annual intake for the undergraduate programme was increased to 1049 by 2011. Campus Hostels A and B hostels accommodate 1st-year B.Tech students. II-year and III-year B.Tech students are accommodated in the New Mega Hostel. G Hostel has been reallocated as a ladies' hostel, and female students enrolled in Ph.D. are staying in G hostel. Final year B.Tech students are accommodated in D, E, F, and PG-I hostels.

As a logged-in user you have a collection of personal links Editing a page It's very easy to edit the contents of a wiki: Click the \"Edit\" page tab at the top of the page. Make changes to the text. Click the \"Save page\" button. Simple as that! But there is a catch, there are some rules that you need to follow while editing pages... The number one rule of wiki editing is to be bold. Go ahead—make changes. Other people can correct any mistakes you make, so have confidence, and give it a try! There are all kinds of editing conventions, rules, and philosophies for the editing of wiki pages, but the be bold rule is the most important of these! An edit can contribute whole new paragraphs or pages of information, or it can be as simple as fixing a typo or a spelling mistake. In general, try to add or edit text so that it is clear and concise. Most importantly, make sure you are always aiming to do something which improves the contents of the wiki. When you need to use some type of formatting, such as for new headings or bolding of text, you do this using wiki syntax or the buttons in the edit toolbar above the editing zone.

      "content": "Navigation Every page on a WIKI FOSSCELL NITC site not only has information to show you but also allows you to move to other pages. This is called \"navigation\". The three main navigation elements are.. The sidebar. You need to log-in before seeing all the sidebar options. Links (often called tabs) which relate to the page currently displayed: its associated discussion page, the version history, and – most notably – the edit link. User links; as an anonymous user, you'll see a link to create an account or log in. As a logged-in user you have a collection of personal links Editing a page It's very easy to edit the contents of a wiki: Click the \"Edit\" page tab at the top of the page. Make changes to the text. Click the \"Save page\" button. Simple as that! But there is a catch, there are some rules that you need to follow while editing pages... The number one rule of wiki editing is to be bold. Go ahead—make changes. Other people can correct any mistakes you make, so have confidence, and give it a try! There are all kinds of editing conventions, rules, and philosophies for the editing of wiki pages, but the be bold rule is the most important of these! An edit can contribute whole new paragraphs or pages of information, or it can be as simple as fixing a typo or a spelling mistake. In general, try to add or edit text so that it is clear and concise. Most importantly, make sure you are always aiming to do something which improves the contents of the wiki. When you need to use some type of formatting, such as for new headings or bolding of text, you do this using wiki syntax or the buttons in the edit toolbar above the editing zone. Starting a new page There are several ways to start a new page. From the search box If you search for a page that doesn't exist, then you will be provided with a link to create the new page. Using the URL You can use the wiki's URL for creating a new page. The URL to an article of the wiki is usually something like this: http://wiki.fosscell.org/index.php/ARTICLE If you replace ARTICLE with the name of the page you wish to create, you will be taken to a blank page which indicates that no article of that name exists yet.

I first step foot to the NITC Campus at around mid-2019. I'll be honest I had no clue about the rich history and culture of campus that day. Just like every other fresher, the first thing I searched on YouTube was about Tathva and Ragam. I loved the trailers and aftermovies of all those events so much that I considered everyone who got featured in any of them as a celebrity. I had a chance to meet quite a few of them and had the privilege to be friends with them. This Blog entry is an effort to document our lives here as NITCians so that those who come after us also have insight into how we lived, how we endured and tackled engineering and other problems with what we have. I'll break this into different years and try to link everything to their pages so that there is more info have fun reading and maybe write your own by creating an account. First Year For most of my peers and myself, it was the first time staying away from family. Sure there were a lot of students who were staying in institutes like Brilliant Pala, Chaithanya Narayana, and Kota for a year or more to crack JEE that had already gone through this. But arguably we had more freedom. Or so we thought. I see many of the senior batch kids even from my batch that used to envy b21s and batches below for the freedom they got to enjoy. Pre-covid campus and hostels were highly restrictive when it came to first year and females. Hostel committee meetings were a nightmare for many and the number of students who got mouthfuls for \"Breaking rules\" was not few. The rules especially for first years were set for their safety. To tackle ragging first years were strongly discouraged and even punished for having interaction with seniors or going to places where the seniors don't want you to go. I used to think that the logic the hostel administration was following was such that, \"Senior students won't rag you if we rag you first\". Still, with all the shackles in place, the first sem was more eventful including SAC onam, carpe diem, and ofc Tathva. Darshan Raval and Infra were the 2 extreme peaks of pleasure and pain we had in the sem. Soon after tathva the campus started getting Ready for Ragam. The Home Team Inductions had started and like everyone else I showed up to NLHC to test my luck. After multiple rounds of screening and war between seniors for juniors I got into the NITC Mime Team. NITC Mime Team The journey with the Mime team members to Ragam was physically and mentally draining but instead of weakening us, the journey had made us stronger. We were at our physical peak during Ragam after the drills we went through and our minds were sharp. From day 0 to day of Ragam we underwent moments of joy and sorrow and were taken into the Mimehood. The night before Ragam after going through everything according to creed we played the final dress rehearsal before all the Mime seniors and super seniors. with them applauding as a mark of approval we were ready to play Ragam Mime next day. We all broke our hearts when the result came and we had lost the 10 year streak of first price and that was the emotianal all time low we had. The wound didn't heal for a long time until we went to Christ University and secured first place from 6 colleges that participated. The journey to Christ was a broke, confusing and depressing one, but the result made sure we came back to campus with our heads high.

Still, with all the shackles in place, the first sem was more eventful including SAC onam, carpe diem, and ofc Tathva. Darshan Raval and Infra were the 2 extreme peaks of pleasure and pain we had in the sem. I also joined the Students' Commune which was started by some of our seniors. The commune was an unofficial student organisation that believed in need of student unity and political awareness for having a healthier campus. Soon after tathva the campus started getting Ready for Ragam. The Home Team Inductions had started and like everyone else I showed up to NLHC to test my luck. After multiple rounds of screening and war between seniors for juniors I got into the NITC Mime Team.

The wound didn't heal for a long time until we went to Christ University and secured first place from 6 colleges that participated. The journey to Christ was a broken, confusing, and depressing one, but the result made sure we came back to campus with our heads high. Now we had very few days on campus post-Ragam as COVID-19 had started spreading all over the globe. As cases started to get reported in Kerala the institute had declared 1 week holiday and we all went home thinking we'll be back after a week. WE DIDN'T! Stuck at home disconnected what was left of semester 2 was completed online. And b16s had to leave campus in one of the saddest ways imaginable. Second Year Online had become the \"New Normal\" when we started the second year classes. It was at around this point when one of my senior had asked me in a random whatsapp \"Aren't you a communist ? Which Linux OS are you using ?\" even tho I wasn't one at that time I was slanting towards socialist side of the political map. The question he asked was hurt me in ways I don't understand even now and I wiped my laptop and thus began my journey using GNU/Linux. It has to be noted that this random chat is fr a cannon event and chances are I'd have not reached my current career path nor hosted this mediawiki instance. I was never good at making partitions and that's mostly the reason I wanted to single boot Ubuntu at that time instead of dualbooting. And at around this time I had lost my android phone (Nexus 6P) RIP and unlike the current whatsapp web we take for granted the feature to keep the web working without phone connected to internet was not possible. This was the same case when I was using windows too. I had relied on bluestacks and leapdroid later to use whatsapp and other social media apps. So finding an alternative to this at the time was a hard process. I went through a lot of options like anbox but later settled with genemotion player. the classes were mostly in webex and it's variants. everything else worked pretty fine except for webex training. I never got it to get working on my ubuntu machine and I used to run a Windows 7 VM just for using Webex Training. It was simply by trying to use my computer normally like a windows user but in linux and to get some power user tools I learned it's beauty and how you can utilize it for much more. The \"Senior\" who had asked the communist linux question returns this time asking if I was running KDE to customise my setup. I had heard of the term KDE but was unaware what a desktop environment was at that time. And I decided to install plasma desktop along with the default gnome setup that comes out of the box. this did result in my pc getting somewhat bloated and eventually resulted in me installing manjaro instead for the 4th semester.

I first step foot to the NITC Campus at around mid-2019. I'll be honest I had no clue about the rich history and culture of campus that day. Just like every other fresher, the first thing I searched on YouTube was about Tathva and Ragam. I loved the trailers and aftermovies of all those events so much that I considered everyone who got featured in any of them as a celebrity. I had a chance to meet quite a few of them and had the privilege to be friends with them. This Blog entry is an effort to document our lives here as NITCians so that those who come after us also have insight into how we lived, how we endured and tackled engineering and other problems with what we have. I'll break this into different years and try to link everything to their pages so that there is more info have fun reading and maybe write your own by creating an account. First Year For most of my peers and myself, it was the first time staying away from family. Sure there were a lot of students who were staying in institutes like Brilliant Pala, Chaithanya Narayana, and Kota for a year or more to crack JEE that had already gone through this. But arguably we had more freedom. Or so we thought. I see many of the senior batch kids even from my batch that used to envy b21s and batches below for the freedom they got to enjoy. Pre-covid campus and hostels were highly restrictive when it came to first year and females. Hostel committee meetings were a nightmare for many and the number of students who got mouthfuls for \"Breaking rules\" was not few. The rules especially for first years were set for their safety. To tackle ragging first years were strongly discouraged and even punished for having interaction with seniors or going to places where the seniors don't want you to go. I used to think that the logic the hostel administration was following was such that, \"Senior students won't rag you if we rag you first\". Still, with all the shackles in place, the first sem was more eventful including SAC onam, carpe diem, and ofc Tathva. Darshan Raval and Infra were the 2 extreme peaks of pleasure and pain we had in the sem. I also joined the Students' Commune which was started by some of our seniors. The commune was an unofficial student organization that believed in the need for student unity and political awareness to have a healthier campus. Soon after tathva the campus started getting Ready for Ragam. The Home Team Inductions had started and like everyone else, I showed up to NLHC to test my luck. After multiple rounds of screening and war between seniors for juniors I got into the NITC Mime Team. NITC Mime Team The journey with the Mime team members to Ragam was physically and mentally draining but instead of weakening us, the journey had made us stronger. We were at our physical peak during Ragam after the drills we went through and our minds were sharp. From day 0 to day of Ragam we underwent moments of joy and sorrow and were taken into the Mimehood. The night before Ragam after going through everything according to creed we played the final dress rehearsal before all the Mime seniors and super seniors. with them applauding as a mark of approval we were ready to play Ragam Mime the next day. We all broke our hearts when the result came and we had lost the 10-year streak of the first price and that was the emotional all-time low we had. The wound didn't heal for a long time until we went to Christ University and secured first place from 6 colleges that participated. The journey to Christ was a broken, confusing, and depressing one, but the result made sure we came back to campus with our heads high. Now we had very few days on campus post-Ragam as COVID-19 had started spreading all over the globe. As cases started to get reported in Kerala the institute had declared 1 week holiday and we all went home thinking we'll be back after a week. WE DIDN'T! Stuck at home disconnected what was left of semester 2 was completed online. And b16s had to leave campus in one of the saddest ways imaginable. Second Year Online had become the \"New Normal\" when we started the second-year classes. It was at around this point when one of my seniors asked me in a random WhatsApp chat \" Aren't you a communist ? Which Linux OS are you using ?\" even tho I wasn't one at that time (I was slanting towards the socialist side of the political map) The question he asked was hurt me in ways I don't understand even now and I wiped my laptop and thus began my journey using GNU/Linux. It has to be noted that this random chat is fr a cannon event and chances are I'd have not reached my current career path nor hosted this MediaWiki instance. I was never good at making partitions and that's mostly the reason I wanted to single-boot Ubuntu at that time instead of dual-booting. At around this time, I had lost my Android phone (Nexus 6P) RIP and unlike the current WhatsApp web we take for granted the feature to keep the web working without a phone connected to the internet was not possible. This was the same case when I was using Windows too. I relied on Bluestacks and Leapdroid later to use WhatsApp and other social media apps. So finding an alternative to this at the time was a hard process. I went through a lot of options like Anbox but later settled with Genemotion player. the classes were mostly in Webex and its variants. everything else worked pretty fine except for Webex training. I never got it to get working on my Ubuntu machine and I used to run a Windows 7 VM just for using Webex Training. It was simply by trying to use my computer normally like a Windows user but in Linux and to get some power user tools I learned its beauty and how you can utilize it for much more. The \"Senior\" who had asked the communist Linux question returned this time asking if I was running KDE to customize my setup. I had heard of the term KDE but was unaware of what a desktop environment was at that time. And I decided to install plasma-desktop along with the default gnome setup that comes out of the box. this did result in my PC getting somewhat bloated and eventually resulted in me installing Manjaro instead for the 4th The Club induction went on online and it was fun. I was a huge fan of the Crow Talks By LnD. The seniors Who knew me had already sensed I was gonna be a typical LnD kid. But during the inductions, I had a change of mind. I had this feeling that LnD would only increase my impulses and also since they had subgroups on a linguistic basis I was confused If I should choose Malayalam or English. I wasn't that comfortable using English then and felt that choosing Malayalam would restrict me from improving my English but also was scared to jump straight into English with the vocabulary I had. ICA Came out of nowhere and I loved their Interview and I realized it's like one of the chillest clubs. So I decided to stick with them and chill out. I wasn't very active in the club but and missed every single carpe diem due to one reason or another. But overall I had fun throughout the years when the campus returned to offline. I also got inducted to Team Unwired Nothing that can be normally categorized as exciting happened during the 2nd year since it was online. Except maybe us starting an internet radio for campus. I'll write a side story of how we started Rajpath RECalls later sometime.

I scheduled the event on the day of the CSE farewell and missed one of the major group of audience for the session. The B18s tried to conduct Tathva 20 online. They had done everything possible by themselves with the constraints and had conducted workshops and lectures online focusing on the motto Tathva for a Social Cause.

We used OBS Studio to capture the video stream. Problems faced We had trouble with DSLR input and this could have been mitigated if we tested this a day before. The problem was that we thought DSLR video input could be taken as plug and play but it wasn't the case in GNU/Linux. We ended up using Windows with proprietary drivers from Canon. We didn't know much about gstreamer and the run time heat prevented us from testing it. We didn't have an audio input line from the Audio team, and the wire they provided made static. Please put down audio input to laptop via USB/AUX as a requirement from the Audio team. We had to use the DSLR's mic as input, it was OK but not the best. Stream key setup in OBS Studio/Streaming settings tab. However assuming DSLR input and an audio input is ready in OBS, head over to settings/Streaming. Here set the upstream link as rtmp://domain>:<custom_port>/app_name in the nginx config (our app_name was hls and domain was live.fosscell.org, check rtmp block in nginx config above). You can choose to omit :custom_port if you are using 1935 (default). We didn't setup authentication in our nginx server, that could be explored by the next years team! Once this is done, you can just hit start streaming in OBS :). Retrieved from ‘https://wiki.fosscell.org/index.php?title=FOSSMeet_Video_Team&oldid=1084’",

      "content": "Dear All, We would like to announce an upgrade to our internal IT infrastructure. We have implemented a new internal Ubuntu Mirror Server for NIT Calicut. This internal mirror server will offer a faster and more reliable resource for Ubuntu package downloads. This is accessible from outside the NITC network, so users do not need to change the configuration when they are outside the NITC network. The server is strategically located in CNC to optimize bandwidth usage, reducing strain on external networks. To start using the new internal Ubuntu Mirror Server, simply update your package manager configuration. Below are the details you'll need: Mirror URL: http://mirror.nitc.ac.in/ubuntu/ Mirror Type: HTTP, HTTPS To start benefiting from our new Ubuntu Mirror Server, simply update your Ubuntu system's package sources by modifying the '/etc/apt/sources.list' file. Replace the existing repository URLs with the following: deb http://mirror.nitc.ac.in/ubuntu/ <ubuntu-version> main restricted deb http://mirror.nitc.ac.in/ubuntu/ <ubuntu-version>-updates main restricted deb http://mirror.nitc.ac.in/ubuntu/ <ubuntu-version> universe deb http://mirror.nitc.ac.in/ubuntu/ <ubuntu-version>-updates universe deb http://mirror.nitc.ac.in/ubuntu/ <ubuntu-version> multiverse deb http://mirror.nitc.ac.in/ubuntu/ <ubuntu-version>-updates multiverse deb http://mirror.nitc.ac.in/ubuntu/ <ubuntu-version>-security main restricted deb http://mirror.nitc.ac.in/ubuntu/ <ubuntu-version>-security universe deb http://mirror.nitc.ac.in/ubuntu/ <ubuntu-version>-security multiverse Replace <ubuntu-version> with the Ubuntu version you are using. Eg: For Ubuntu 22.04, use the jammy For Ubuntu 20.04, use the focal If users encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, they can raise a ticket on https://ticket.nitc.ac.in/ . Special Thanks to Mr Sumesh K S for implementing this facility. Best regards, Admin, CNC, CITRA Retrieved from ‘https://wiki.fosscell.org/index.php?title=Ubuntu_mirror&oldid=1090’",

I first step foot to the NITC Campus at around mid-2019. I'll be honest I had no clue about the rich history and culture of campus that day. Just like every other fresher, the first thing I searched on YouTube was about Tathva and Ragam. I loved the trailers and aftermovies of all those events so much that I considered everyone who got featured in any of them as a celebrity. I had a chance to meet quite a few of them and had the privilege to be friends with them. This Blog entry is an effort to document our lives here as NITCians so that those who come after us also have insight into how we lived, how we endured and tackled engineering and other problems with what we have. I'll break this into different years and try to link everything to their pages so that there is more info have fun reading and maybe write your own by creating an account. First Year For most of my peers and myself, it was the first time staying away from family. Sure there were a lot of students who were staying in institutes like Brilliant Pala, Chaithanya Narayana, and Kota for a year or more to crack JEE that had already gone through this. But arguably we had more freedom. Or so we thought. I see many of the senior batch kids even from my batch that used to envy b21s and batches below for the freedom they got to enjoy. Pre-covid campus and hostels were highly restrictive when it came to first year and females. Hostel committee meetings were a nightmare for many and the number of students who got mouthfuls for \"Breaking rules\" was not few. The rules especially for first years were set for their safety. To tackle ragging first years were strongly discouraged and even punished for having interaction with seniors or going to places where the seniors don't want you to go. I used to think that the logic the hostel administration was following was such that, \"Senior students won't rag you if we rag you first\". Still, with all the shackles in place, the first sem was more eventful including SAC onam, carpe diem, and ofc Tathva. Darshan Raval and Infra were the 2 extreme peaks of pleasure and pain we had in the sem. I also joined the Students' Commune which was started by some of our seniors. The commune was an unofficial student organization that believed in the need for student unity and political awareness to have a healthier campus. Soon after tathva the campus started getting Ready for Ragam. The Home Team Inductions had started and like everyone else, I showed up to NLHC to test my luck. After multiple rounds of screening and war between seniors for juniors I got into the NITC Mime Team. NITC Mime Team The journey with the Mime team members to Ragam was physically and mentally draining but instead of weakening us, the journey had made us stronger. We were at our physical peak during Ragam after the drills we went through and our minds were sharp. From day 0 to day of Ragam we underwent moments of joy and sorrow and were taken into the Mimehood. The night before Ragam after going through everything according to creed we played the final dress rehearsal before all the Mime seniors and super seniors. with them applauding as a mark of approval we were ready to play Ragam Mime the next day. We all broke our hearts when the result came and we had lost the 10-year streak of the first price and that was the emotional all-time low we had. The wound didn't heal for a long time until we went to Christ University and secured first place from 6 colleges that participated. The journey to Christ was a broken, confusing, and depressing one, but the result made sure we came back to campus with our heads high. Now we had very few days on campus post-Ragam as COVID-19 had started spreading all over the globe. As cases started to get reported in Kerala the institute had declared 1 week holiday and we all went home thinking we'll be back after a week. WE DIDN'T! Stuck at home disconnected what was left of semester 2 was completed online. And b16s had to leave campus in one of the saddest ways imaginable. Second Year Online had become the \"New Normal\" when we started the second-year classes. It was at around this point when one of my seniors asked me in a random WhatsApp chat \" Aren't you a communist ? Which Linux OS are you using ?\" even tho I wasn't one at that time (I was slanting towards the socialist side of the political map) The question he asked was hurt me in ways I don't understand even now and I wiped my laptop and thus began my journey using GNU/Linux. It has to be noted that this random chat is fr a cannon event and chances are I'd have not reached my current career path nor hosted this MediaWiki instance. I was never good at making partitions and that's mostly the reason I wanted to single-boot Ubuntu at that time instead of dual-booting. At around this time, I had lost my Android phone (Nexus 6P) RIP and unlike the current WhatsApp web we take for granted the feature to keep the web working without a phone connected to the internet was not possible. This was the same case when I was using Windows too. I relied on Bluestacks and Leapdroid later to use WhatsApp and other social media apps. So finding an alternative to this at the time was a hard process. I went through a lot of options like Anbox but later settled with Genemotion player. the classes were mostly in Webex and its variants. everything else worked pretty fine except for Webex training. I never got it to get working on my Ubuntu machine and I used to run a Windows 7 VM just for using Webex Training. It was simply by trying to use my computer normally like a Windows user but in Linux and to get some power user tools I learned its beauty and how you can utilize it for much more. The \"Senior\" who had asked the communist Linux question returned this time asking if I was running KDE to customize my setup. I had heard of the term KDE but was unaware of what a desktop environment was at that time. And I decided to install plasma-desktop along with the default gnome setup that comes out of the box. this did result in my PC getting somewhat bloated and eventually resulted in me installing Manjaro instead for the 4th The Club induction went on online and it was fun. I was a huge fan of the Crow Talks By LnD. The seniors Who knew me had already sensed I was gonna be a typical LnD kid. But during the inductions, I had a change of mind. I had this feeling that LnD would only increase my impulses and also since they had subgroups on a linguistic basis I was confused If I should choose Malayalam or English. I wasn't that comfortable using English then and felt that choosing Malayalam would restrict me from improving my English but also was scared to jump straight into English with the vocabulary I had. ICA Came out of nowhere and I loved their Interview and I realized it's like one of the chillest clubs. So I decided to stick with them and chill out. I wasn't very active in the club but and missed every single carpe diem due to one reason or another. But overall I had fun throughout the years when the campus returned to offline. I also got inducted to Team Unwired Nothing that can be normally categorized as exciting happened during the 2nd year since it was online. Except maybe us starting an internet radio for campus. I'll write a side story of how we started Rajpath RECalls later sometime. The students' commune had started conducting online sessions on various topics and I organized a session with Abraham Reji on the topic \"Free Software, its impact, and sustainability\". I scheduled the event on the day of the CSE farewell and missed one of the major group of audience for the session. The B18s tried to conduct Tathva 20 online. They had done everything possible by themselves with the constraints and had conducted workshops and lectures online focusing on the motto Tathva for a Social Cause. Ragam also followed a similar model in 2021 by B17s and at around this time some of the Seniors had returned to the deserted campus. I along with some of my friends did a road trip to Calicut after the 4th semester to recover what was left of the luggage that was left in our rooms. After multiple days of sitting and growing roots inside our homes coming to campus even if it was just for a day and meeting all the batchmates was a fresh air to all of us. 3rd year Within 2 months of vacation, we were \"3rd Year Students\" but also at the state of being first year. The long-awaited B20s have joined and we started creating WhatsApp groups to meet and get to know them. The online interaction which maintains records helped decrease the cases of ragging as juniors can easily report any kind of rude behavior to the authorities. This had shifted the junior-senior interaction and its dynamic for better or for worse. I got chance to come back and live in campus because of team unwired. we were preparing for the SAE formula Supra Race that was supposed to be held during July 2022. And it was at the same time the 60th Jubilee celebrations got announced. The home teams were requested to come back to campus and perform for the event that was scheduled to be held on 31st December. And with that I got to train the Mime juniors along with other Mime seniors. ALl the Home teams made their comeback and performed for the Jubilee.

And ig we managed to fork another debian based distro naed Eznix OS and get gnome to be working in the ISO. The Plan Was to have an OS in which most of the students starting off with at least the circuit branch students to install unBOS ( The word comes from anbu tamil which means love ? also kinda similar to unbox change x with an s) and then they can have all the software and tools that are necessary for their academic and general campus related activities. Some of the features include Storing the wifi login in gnome-keyring ? (I've no clue if that's even possible the idea is to keep it secure) and have a widget through which u can one tap connect and disconnect to the NITC network login. We had a python script made during the Friday night foss even that had happened earlier that sem and it helped user clean up all the emails. so having that pre-installed and configured to auto clean spam mails such as the ones having keywords lost ticket etc. Dynamic Timetable based on CalDav was also in discussions. so that the CR or the faculty can dynamically assign rescheduled cancel classes and it should get updated in user calendars.

Ever since its birth in the REC times, the club has taken up the mantle of providing the students a rostrum to flaunt their belletristic, oratory and expressive genius. Kindled by the passion for the world of literature, the club is a stage to express, enunciate and extemporize. Through the years, we have been striving persistently to spread our expense in close accordance with our rule of thumb, 'Deeds not Words'. Organizing competitions in extempore, elocution, debates, quizzes and so much more has helped the club live up to and beyond the expectations for which it was set up. The Literary & Debating Club conduct several activities like Sunset by the Main, Kaapikootam, Book club meetings and are involved in Crowtalks, Humans of NIT (HONIT), Pride week, Mental Health week, Page Turners, etc. Retrieved from ‘https://wiki.fosscell.org/index.php?title=Literary_and_Debating_Club&oldid=1136’",

Make sure you update the ledger simultaneously whenever you do a transaction.

Free software is a matter of the users' freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. More precisely, it refers to four kinds of freedom, for the users of the software: The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0). The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2). The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition for this. For more information, please visit http://gnu.org Vision Free and Open Source Software is much more than a superior technology. It is a philosophy which lays emphasis on the rights of a user to copy, study, modify and redistribute code. It is based on the belief that Knowledge is a common heritage of mankind, and thus software, a form of knowledge, has to be free and accessible to all. Our vision is a society where the sharing of Knowledge is the norm, rather than the exception. Action Plan Popularize the use and spread awareness, in the campus, about the advantages of using Free Software, through demonstrations, installation fests etc. Provide support to nearby schools for the IT@School programme. Encourage students to get involved in Free Software development- both community Free Software projects and events like the Google Summer of Code. Discuss how and why FOSS can be used effectively in the curriculum, probably replacing proprietary tools. Initiative to develop FOSS tools in areas where they are lacking.

      "content": "Original Source My thoughts about Freedom and Free Software. Friday, August 31, 2007 The Story of Free Software in Kerala, India This is the story of Free Software in the state of Kerala in India. I wrote this for a book entitled Knowledge Society and Development -- Kerala Experience edited by Antony Palackal of Loyola College, Thiruvananthapuram, and Wesley Shrum of Louisiana State University. The article is published under a free license, as mentioned at the end of the article. I am putting a slightly modified version here so that any interested person can make use of it. Free Software in Kerala V. Sasi Kumar A friend, who had worked in Brazil for a couple of years, once told me, “Kerala is known in Latin America for Free Software.” This indicates the extent to which Kerala has dominated the Free Software scenario in India. It is not by chance that the headquarters of the Free Software Foundation of India happened to be situated at Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala. The state is now poised to become the ﬁrst in the country to introduce exclusively Free Software for IT education in high schools. We shall examine here how all this came about. But before that, we shall look at what the term Free Software1 means. Free Software is software that gives users freedom-four freedoms, to be precise. As the website of the Free Software Foundation (http://www.gnu.org) says: “Free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech”, not as in “free ice cream”. Free software is a matter of the users' freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. More precisely, it refers to four kinds of freedom, for the users of the software: • The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0). • The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this. • The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbour (freedom 2). • The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community beneﬁts (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition for this. Free Software began to be developed when Richard M. Stallman, a programmer with the Artiﬁcial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, resigned and started the GNU (recursive acronym for GNU is Not Unix) project in 1984. Later, he also started the Free Software Foundation (FSF). Today, there is a large volume of Free Software, and the most popular Free operating system is GNU/Linux (sometimes called simply Linux). We capitalise the F and S in Free Software to distinguish it from proprietary software that is distributed free of cost, sometimes called freeware. We shall also use the shortened form, FS. So, with that, we shall now take a look at the story of FS in Kerala. The story is bound to be biased by my experiences and limited by my knowledge. Individuals or organisations who have contributed to the Free Software movement in the state may have been left out from the narration, even though this is written after speaking to several people who were involved right from the beginning of the movement. I apologise for any such omissions and assure the readers that they are inadvertent and not deliberate. The Beginning The story apparently began with the introduction of TeX, the typesetting program that was designed in the 1970s by Donald Knuth, the author of The Art of Computer Programming, a four volume classic. TeX was introduced into Kerala by Prof. K.S.S. Namburipad of the Department of Mathematics in the University of Kerala. TeX could typeset mathematical equations very neatly, which no other software could do, especially in the 1980s when Prof. Namburipad brought TeX in fourteen ﬂoppy disks from the United States. He could bring the program and use it on a number of computers without any legal problem because it had no licences-it was in the public domain. It was, in a sense, the Grandmother of Free Software, as some people call it. Prof. Namburipad encouraged his students to learn and use TeX, especially for preparing their theses. One of his students was E. Krishnan, now with the Mathematics Department of the University College, Thiruvananthapuram, a leading exponent of TeX and one of the auA thors of the very popular LaTeX primer2 published as an electronic book by the Indian TeX User Group. Dr. Krishnan also played an important role in establishing the Free Software Foundation of India. Another person inspired by Prof. Namburipad was one C.V. Radhakrishnan who used to run a small centre that prepared theses for the research students of the Kariavattom campus of the University of Kerala. C.V. Radhakrishnan took serious interest in TeX. He found that there was business opportunity here and with virtually no competition. Eventually, he established a company in 1995, called River Valley Technologies, for doing typesetting of scientiﬁc papers and theses. He had his two brothers with him when he started the company. They used the DOS operating system running on Intel AT machines, along with Novell Netware for networking. Since Unix was rather expensive those days, they did not attempt to use it, though they were familiar with it. Around 1996, a computer vendor who supplied part of their systems suggested that they use Linux, which was very similar to Unix and was free. He also gave them a CD containing the Slackware distribution. It was around this period (March 1996) that the magazine PCQuest brought out CDs containing the Slackware distribution of GNU/Linux, the ﬁrst commercial distribution of the Free operating system. It was probably a copy of this CD that Radhakrishnan got from the vendor. Though the operating system was primitive in some ways, and installing it on a computer was a tough job, it came in handy for the new company. As Radhakrishnan says, “It was very difﬁcult to install Linux those days. It took us about one week to install it on one system. We could link it to Novell Netware since there was a tool for that. Later, we installed it on all machines and discarded Novell Netware.” River Valley Technologies thus took off as possibly the ﬁrst Free Software based company in the state and almost certainly as the ﬁrst TeX based company in the country. Since then, the company has been using GNU/Linux almost exclusively, except for one computer that still runs MS Windows mainly for opening MS Word ﬁles and for some editing of vector graphics for which Free alternatives are not sufﬁciently powerful now. Much of their work is automated so that human intervention is required only minimally. Today, Radhakrishnan is one of the top TeX programmers in the world. His company has seventy employees and their clients include the Institute of Physics, UK, Macmillan (Nature) and Elsevier. The company uses Free Software and also sponsors India's ﬁrst portal to host Free Software projects3. Meanwhile, Satish Babu, CEO of the South Indian Federation of Fishermen's Societies (SIFFS), was using the new technology of the Internet to enhance the efﬁciency of his organisation. He learnt about the Internet when he went to the Hull International Fisheries Institute, UK, in 1993 for training in ﬁsheries management, and he became highly interested in the technology. Though basically a management expert trained at the prestigious Institute of Rural Management, Anand, his interest in the technology prompted him to study computers and programming in depth and virtually made him a programmer. Today he is involved in running a software company4 in the Technopark at Thiruvananthapuram and is actively involved with bodies like the Computer Society of India and the Indian chapter of the Institution of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. He is the Executive Secretary of the Society for Promotion of Alternative Computing and Employment (SPACE), an NGO promoting Free Software, and is an active member of FSF India. After his return from the UK, he started using computers to improve the efficiency of the organisation he was working for. He learnt that email was being implemented through the Ernet network which used VSAT technology at that time. Leo Fernandez of the Indian Social Institute, Bangalore, with which Satish already had links, helped him to link to the Ernet node in Bangalore through a telephone dial-up connection. This was in 1994. Satish conﬁgured his computer to dial-up in the early morning hours when telephone call rates were lowest, and send and receive mails. Though this was slow by today's standards, since an exchange of mails would take at least two days, it was enormously faster than using the postal service. Part of the software he used for this was actually Free Software, though he was not aware of it at that time. It was again Leo Fernandez who introduced him to Linux in 1995. Though not very conﬁdent about the new system, Satish and his friends soon grew to like it, especially since there were a lot of things one could do at the system level. As Satish says, “Once you learn to tinker around with the system, you really start enjoying it and it becomes a habit that is difﬁcult to get over.” And GNU/Linux offered plenty of opportunities for such people. But Satish and friends were still not very much aware of the ideology of Free Software and its implications. His ﬁrst distribution of GNU/Linux, known as Slackware, was given to Satish by Leo Fernandez. Soon, SIFFS organised a training programme in GNU/Linux by Leo. In 1998, Radhakrishnan, Krishnan, Namburipad, Satish and others decided to set up a Linux User Group (LUG) in Thiruvananthapuram. Others associated with this included journalist K.G. Kumar, computer science student M. Arun, and P.M. Sasi, who was with the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC), Thiruvananthapuram. M. Arun was a student of Computer Science at the College of Engineering, Thiruvananthapuram, when his father bought a computer from Keltron (in fact, the ﬁrst computer Keltron sold). This had an operating system developed by IBM known as OS2. As Arun says, “This was much better than Windows 95, which was popular at that time.” One of his friends had got a Packard-Bell computer with MS Windows from the US and wanted to install Linux in it. Arun had a copy of the PC Quest Slackware CD and undertook the job of installing it in the machine. It installed neatly without any problem. So he decided to try it on his computer. But the result was disappointing. He could not get the graphical interface running. One of his friends suggested that he try the Red Hat distribution, and Arun wrote to a company, GTL Enterprises in Bangalore, for a copy of the Red Hat CD. They replied asking him to contact the local Linux User Group, which C.V. Radhakrishnan and others had just started. Arun went to Radhakrishnan's ofﬁce with his friend Amit and not only obtained the CD but also joined the LUG. They started having weekly meetings. Arun found that a few teachers in their college were interested in GNU/Linux. They got the college to purchase some manuals from FSF, Boston. Arun and a few of his friends had read about the ideology of Free Software and were attracted by it. In 1999, Wros Publishers organised a conference called Bang! Linux in Bangalore. Arun and a few other students went for the conference. Richard M. Stallman (known by his initials RMS), the founder of the GNU project and the Free Software Foundation, was there. This was his ﬁrst meeting in India and his lecture impressed the students from Kerala. They came back thoroughly convinced about the ideology of Free Software. Today, Arun is the secretary of the Free Software Foundation of India and is also the co-ordinator of SPACE. With the new millennium came the group known as Free Developers. This was started by one Tony Stanco, an advocate from the US, who proposed that they start a company that would do business using Free Software and eventually make it the leading software globally. He had corresponded with RMS about his ideas. Though RMS was sceptical about the feasibility of the project, Tony went ahead with it and managed to obtain support from a number of people, including C.V. Radhakrishnan, Arun and others in Kerala. This initiative helped in developing the dotGNU project, which was a free substitute for Microsoft's .NET, since several people from India joined the project. The discussions in the Thiruvananthapuram LUG soon led to the ideology of Free Software, which the members found attractive. They discussed the idea of establishing a Free Software Foundation of India, and a unit of Free Developers. FSF India, they hoped, would act to supervise the ethical aspects of Free Developers. Radhakrishnan got in touch with Richard Stallman and got his approval for starting FSF India, and got him to agree to inaugurate FSF India. Satish Babu, who was then the Regional Vice-President of the Computer Society of India, took the initiative to organise the inaugural function. It was decided to inaugurate the Indian branch of Free Developers also at the same function. Freedom First The conference organised at Thiruvananthapuram in connection with the inauguration of Free Software Foundation of India was aptly called Freedom First. The name was suggested by the journalist K.G. Kumar and it must have immediately struck a chord with the others. Richard Stallman was the chief guest for the conference, and he was received as an honoured state guest by government ofﬁcials to discuss the philosophy behind the movement. The Organising Committee formed to conduct the conference included Radhakrishnan, Satish Babu, Arun, Krishnan, Rajkumar (who runs a Free Software business), P.M. Sasi, K.G. Kumar, Dr. K.R. Srivathsan (Director, IIITMK5), and others. The function in the morning, in which FSF India was inaugurated by Stallman, was chaired by the Secretary to the Government, Information Technology Department. About 300 people from all over the state and even outside were present, ﬁlling the auditorium beyond its capacity. “Computer users in India, as elsewhere, deserve the freedom to share and change software, the way cooks share and change recipes. So I am pleased to inaugurate the Free Software Foundation of India, which will promote the use and the development of free software in this country”, Stallman told the gathering. Later, he met the Minister for Information Technology and held discussions on promoting Free Software in the state. The afternoon session was devoted to the inauguration of Free Developers India and some technical presentations. There were a couple of interesting moments during Stallman's visit. At the airport, a number of people were curious to see a ﬁgure with long hair and long beard and wanted to know who he was. When he understood what they were asking, he introduced himself, “I am Saint IGNUcious of the church of Emacs.”6 Possibly, some people took that seriously! There was a poignant moment when Stallman was going to a hotel for lunch along with a few other people. One of them told Stallman that Nelson Mandela had signed a Freedom Declaration that had been put up at the Free Developers website. “RMS just couldn't believe that and he almost cried. He said Mandela had always been his hero.” wrote Ramakrishnan (one of the others in the vehicle) later. When someone tried to compare Stallman with Mandela, RMS retorted that whatever he has done could never be compared with the 25 years in prison that Mandela had suffered. It was an achievement of FS enthusiasts in the state that the government agreed to support the event and treat RMS as a state guest. As a report in Linux Today7 said: Government ofﬁcials and other Free Software supporters in the state of Kerala believe that Free Software meshes particularly well with Kerala's long tradition of democracy, equity and public action. Just as Kerala is often held up as a model of equitable social and human development in the region, Free Software supporters there believe they can leverage the inherent freedoms of Free Software to evolve an equitable Knowledge Society based on software independence and self- reliance. The conference was a great success in many ways. It attracted a lot of media attention and made 'Free Software' and Richard Stallman' popular among the public. Advocacy There have been a few instances where the Free Software community was able to inﬂuence decision makers to choose Free Software over proprietary. In some cases, the decisive breakthrough was achieved by individual effort, while in some cases, it was a community effort. We shall look into two cases here, that of the implementation of a network by the Public Works Department and that of the introduction of IT education in schools. PWD Network One of the ﬁrst successful campaigns for Free Software was in the Public Works Department of the state. InApp Technologies, the company started by Satish Babu, Amarnath Raja and others, was asked to make a proposal for a PWD project by one of the Secretaries of the PWD. InApp made it clear that while they do work with all technologies, they would quote only for a Free platform, as they considered it as most appropriate for any e-governance project. The consultant to the Kerala Transportation Project, under which the application was being planned, felt that he did not know sufﬁciently about Free Software, and obtained quotes from Microsoft and Oracle. However, the Secretary concerned knew about InApp and suggested to the Principal Secretary that InApp's proposal should be considered seriously. A debate was therefore organised to (a) explain what Free Software was, and (b) what its advantages were over proprietary platforms. This debate was conducted by the then PWD Principal Secretary and was attended by two other Secretaries, the consultant to the Transportation Project, some Chief Engineers and senior people from the PWD. Two people from Microsoft, one from Oracle, Amarnath Raja and Satish formed the participants. Satish was armed with a survey conducted among Technopark companies about their perceptions on Free Software in December 2002 (http://gtechindia.org/jsp/survey.pdf), which was conducted by Satish who was the GTech Treasurer. The study had clearly shown the features of Free Software that made it attractive especially for e-governance projects. Microsoft came prepared with their “sponsored research” ﬁndings. Since Satish and Amarnath were prepared for it, they were easily able to refute their ﬁndings. Microsoft possibly did not expect this, and perhaps had thought that this would be a walkover. The person from Oracle was unaware of the local politics and looked surprised by the ferocity of the debate. He started off pro-Microsoft, but shifted to the Free Software camp half-way through. The Secretaries were convinced about the need to go Free, and InApp got the order. The application was delivered and is running well. IT@School Project Another successful campaign, which was driven by a large number of FS enthusiasts and received much more publicity, was that for the inclusion of Free Software in IT education in schools. The Department of Education, Government of Kerala, started a project called IT@School for bringing IT enabled education to the high schools in the state. The project constituted a committee headed by Prof. U.R. Rao, former Chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation, to make recommendations on the direction the project should take. After studying the status of education in the state and elaborate discussions, the Committee recommended that the project should aim to bring IT to high schools in the state to empower teachers and to use the technology for improving curriculum transaction in the classes. However, the project found that most of the teachers and the students possessed little IT skills. They, therefore, decided to start IT education at the high school level initially. IT was thus introduced in the eighth standard in the year 2002 after conducting training in IT for a large number of teachers. The teacher training was organised using help from the Intel Teach to the Future programme, and their course material, which was wholly based on Microsoft software, was used for the training. Struggle for Free Software The textbook for IT prepared by the State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT) was based purely on Microsoft Windows and other Microsoft applications like MS Ofﬁce. The Free Software community in the state found this very offensive, since it ignored the existence of Free Software and promoted the products of one company ignoring even other proprietary software. The community responded by talking to people, sending letters, writing in the media and so on. The Free Software User Group in Kochi prepared a memorandum and sent it to several people involved in the matter, including the Directors of the IT@School project and SCERT, the Director of Public Instruction, the Principal Secretary, Education Department, and the Secretary, IT Department. They pointed out that: • IT@School was promoting the software of one company at the cost of software produced by everyone else; • the government would have to pay an enormous amount for licencing the software for the schools; • even if the company gives the software for the schools free of cost, it is only a marketing ploy in order to reap beneﬁts of having a pool of people who are familiar with their software packages and thus form an assured customer base, either as users themselves or as potential skilled employees; • the Government's approach would result in compelling not only schools, but also the general public to purchase software from this particular vendor in the future. This would create a monopoly in favour of that corporation and expose the public, the State and the nation to the mercy of a single company; • the corporation, whose brands and products are prescribed in the syllabus, does not publish the standards used in their software. This practice compels other people who have to interact with users of the products of this corporation (like the government and schools, in this case) to purchase software from this particular vendor only-a situation known as 'vendor lock-in'; • the government is promoting illegal copying and installation of software in the computers in the schools by not providing for software costs; • handling licencing issues is not simple and there has been at least one instance in which a school in the US had to pay $ 300,000 as ﬁne-even screenshots used in textbooks may have to be licenced; • several software packages, both applications as well as operating systems, which conform to industry-wide standards, adopted and maintained by independent vendors, and with less restrictive licences, are available. The Kerala School Teachers Association decided to throw its weight behind the demand from Free Software enthusiasts. The government and the IT@School project were still not willing to change. However, due to pressure from several directions, SCERT decided to incorporate Free Software also in the textbook and rewrote the textbook for the eighth standard for the academic year 2003-04. Sri N.K. Satyapalan, who was the person in charge of IT education at the State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT) played an important role in pushing Free Software into the textbook. Some schools, especially in northern Kerala, where there were teachers who knew how to install and use GNU/Linux, installed it and started IT classes using it. In order to ensure that all schools did buy sufﬁcient computers and taught IT, it was also decided to include IT as an additional subject and conduct examinations, though with less marks than other subjects. Computerised Examination An important phase started when the IT@School project decided to conduct part of the IT examination using a software. They developed a software called Softexam for conducting the examination. This was designed primarily for the MS Windows platform and some of the schools using GNU/Linux had to install MS Windows to enable the software. There was immediate protest from the Teachers Association and the Project was forced to develop Softexam for GNU/Linux also. However, this is now being virtually discontinued, with the software being conﬁned to presenting previously prepared questions randomly and saving the responses for later evaluation by teachers. One problem with using GNU/Linux was that there were several distributions of the OS, each slightly different from the others, and schools had installed different distributions. Even preparing the textbook became difﬁcult, since the screenshots, and sometimes even the procedures for using the software, could be different for different distributions. To solve this problem, the Free Software Foundation of India suggested developing a custom distribution for IT@School, and eventually created the distribution with funding from the Kerala State IT Mission. Another problem that the IT@School project faced was that of providing support to the schools where GNU/Linux was being used. They called for private agencies who were willing to provide support to register with them. A number of agencies, including Free Software User Groups, responded and about twenty of them were short listed. A ﬁnal solution to the problem came when SPACE (mentioned earlier) decided to offer support to IT@School, both in terms of updating the distribution used in schools and in providing support to the teacher community. The website of SPACE now has provided for teachers to post questions there, to which experts will respond, and also a page listing the Frequently Asked Questions and the answers to them. The IT@School project arranged for teachers to be trained in GNU/Linux and a majority of teachers have already been trained. A Resource Centre has been established in Kochi for conducting teacher training with technical assistance from SPACE. In 2005, the government announced that the schools in Kerala will completely switch to Free Software in stages. Supplements to the textbooks were created to enable students to study using GNU/Linux, which also introduced some software that a child new to computers could use to learn the skills needed to use a mouse and a keyboard. Tuxpaint, a simple painting software, which a child could use even if (s)he was unfamiliar with the intricacies of saving or retrieving a ﬁle, and Gcompris, a set of games that helped the child to learn how to use the mouse and keyboard, became very popular with children. The textbooks for all the three classes in high school are now being revised to contain Free Software exclusively. Kerala is poised to become the ﬁrst state in the country to use exclusively Free Software in its schools. It is also poised to become possible the ﬁrst state to introduce IT enabled education in high schools in a big way. Visits by Stallman Richard Stallman, founder of the GNU project and FSF, has visited India several times and given lectures in several states. But the state he has visited most often is Kerala, probably because of the large support in this state for his ideology. The ﬁrst time Stallman visited Kerala was for the Freedom First conference in 2001. His next visit was in connection with the EMS Memorial Lecture constituted by Kerala University. Stallman spoke about the danger of software patents at the University Senate Hall on January 24, 2004. The same day he spoke about copyright law and freedom in science at Centre for Earth Science Studies. Both lectures were well attended and there were a number of questions from the audience at both venues. On Independence Day, he interacted with the students of the Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management Kerala (IIITMK). During this visit, Stallman also met the then leader of the Opposition (present Chief Minister) V.S. Achuthanandan, who has been a strong supporter of the Free Software movement, and held discussions on how the government can support and beneﬁt from Free Software. Richard Stallman's latest visit to Kerala has been in August this year (2006). SPACE in association with Kerala State IT Mission conducted a seminar on Free Software for Kerala Development on the 23rd of August. Stallman gave the keynote address in this seminar. The seminar was inaugurated by the Chief Minister, who had a long discussion with Stallman. A report on Free Software Projects in Public Enterprises in Kerala, prepared by SPACE, was released at the function. Stallman was in India to participate in the GPL v3 conference at Bangalore on August 25 and 26. Development A certain amount of Free Software development was done in the state even in the initial days. This includes localisation of the GNOME8 Desktop (that is, making the desktop available in the local language, Malayalam), a project monitoring application for the government and a portal for enhancing transparency in everyday activities of the government. The localisation work was started by Arun and his friends Gopal, Sreekrishna and others soon after the establishment of FSF India. The Managing Director of Keltron, an undertaking of the Government of Kerala, offered to help them in their effort. The idea was that the government and other users could be provided a platform in Malayalam for their uses. They managed to get support from Asia-Paciﬁc Development Information Programme (APDIP), an initiative developed and funded by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), for the work. “Speciﬁcally, the project aims to create Free Font for Malayalam, create toolkit (toolkits are basic building blocks in creating Graphical User Interface based applications) with Malayalam support, and create a localised desktop and ofﬁce productivity applications and documentation in Malayalam.”, says the project abstract9 . The work was undertaken by the Kerala Bureau for Industrial Promotion (KBIP) in association with FSF India. All menu and other text, like messages, were translated into Malayalam so that a person who knows only Malayalam could comfortably use a computer with the customised GNOME desktop. Unfortunately, the work was never released to the public because of ofﬁcial apathy. Another Free Software based development was in connection with the Modernising Government Programme (MGP). MGP was drawn up as part of the strategy of the Government to overhaul and improve its services to the people of the State. One of the components of MGP was monitoring projects funded by the government. The Program Performance monitoring system (PPMS) was developed by Keltron (Kerala State Electronics Development Corporation) for tracking the performance of various departments as part of MGP. PPMS contain 4 major projects. The ﬁrst project, PPMS1, is a performance monitoring system for 17 government departments. It covers a total of 93 initiatives of these departments, 50 of them in the ﬁrst phase. The system uses result base management methods to measure performance based on impacts, outputs, outcomes & activities. PPMS2 is a set of service delivery projects. It addresses performance monitoring of 2584 institutions statewide like schools and community health centres and mainly deals with fund ﬂow management, administrative payment orders etc. The Third project is a human resource module named e-bandham. It monitors attendance, leave, travel allowances etc of the program support executives. The fourth project is Sevanamudra, Quality Improvement Program & Performance Certiﬁcation Mechanism for government institutions. Another project done using Free Software is Sutharya Keralam, or Transparent Kerala. This is a Right to Information initiative of the Government of Kerala to ensure transparency and efﬁciency in everyday functions of the government. “The major objectives of the project are the automation of Chief Minister's Grievance Redressal Cell and convergence of all the available forms of Communication so as to guarantee People's Right to Information.”, says its website10. The project was developed completely on Free Software technologies by the Centre for Development of Imaging Technologies (CDIT), an institute under the Government of Kerala. Other Free Software projects in the state include computerisation of the ofﬁces of milk producers unions in the state that come under the Kerala State Milk Marketing Federation (Milma), a Management Information System for the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) developed by CDAC, a District Collectorate Suite developed by the National Informatics Centre and a computerisation project of Calicut University done inhouse. A study on Free Software projects in public enterprises in Kerala has been done by SPACE and is available online11. SPACE The Society for Promotion of Alternative Computing and Employment, or SPACE, is a society promoted by Kerala State IT Mission with the objective of promoting alternative computing, that is, Free, Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS). It has a government nominee in its Board of Directors and has support from professional societies (such as IEEE and the Computer Society of India) and the academia. It had as its ﬁrst Chairman the then Vice Chancellor of the University of Kerala, Dr. B. Ekbal, and members included Satish Babu, Amarnath Raja, P.M. Sasi and C.V. Radhakrishnan. Though it came into existence in 2003, it could not undertake much activity due to lack of funds. This problem was solved when SPACE entered into a tie-up with SOMA for working on joint projects. SPACE became active with the setting up of an ofﬁce and recruiting a few people. Activities started in areas like promoting Virtual Micro Enterprises (VMEs) based on Free Software, advocating FS in colleges and setting up Free Software Cells where feasible, helping in training school teachers in FS, and so on. Some of the achievements of SPACE did attract considerable media attention. One example is the development of a distribution of GNU/Linux speciﬁcally for electronics laboratories in engineering colleges. This was made available on one CD, and was named Free Electron. The distribution was created by the FS Cell in an engineering college in Thiruvananthapuram with help from SPACE. There were a number of requests from colleges inside and outside the state, and even one from abroad. Another distribution that SPACE created for system recovery purposes was distributed by a local IT magazine. A workshop SPACE conducted, in collaboration with another NGO (Mediact) involved in media education, at a village library for creating and publishing a village newsletter in Malayalam also attracted much interest. Another programme that became popularly known was the initiative for setting up a radio station for ﬁsherfolk. Started on the initiative of a few young people from the ﬁshing community in Thiruvananthapuram, Radio Alakal, as it was called, could not start regular broadcast due to some licencing issues, but started narrowcasting (using loud speakers at speciﬁc locations). All the work for Radio Alakal was done using Free Software. SPACE also helped the IT@School project to set up a teacher training centre in Kochi.Free SoFree Software in Businessftware in Business Free Software in Business There are several companies in the state doing business using Free Software. We mentioned River Valley Technologies of Radhakrishnan. Another enterprise in Kochi, Beta Computers, also does business using TeX. An organisation worth mentioning is the Open Software Solutions Industrial Co-operative Society in Kochi. It is a cooperative effort which consists of some young programmers who were involved with the Ernakulam Industrial Infrastructure Development Project. The project started work for computerising the Panchayats (local self-government institution) in the district. They used only Free Software and computerised a few Panchayats. However, the state-wide programme called Information Kerala Mission for the same purpose, which used only proprietary software, superseded their efforts. The youth involved in the project started a co-operative society and started doing business with Free Software. They developed a software for co-operative banks, called Sanghamitra, which has been installed in a number of branches. This is also licenced under the GNU General Public Licence. They have been developing software for other purposes also, and are doing reasonably well. Rajkumar (whose name has been mentioned earlier) runs a business called Linuxense at Thiruvananthapuram. “We are a GNU/Linux-based Enterprise providing software solutions of exceptional quality using cutting-edge technologies; creating a GNU/Linux ambiance for our distinguished clients in their demanding work environments.” says their website12 . They provide support for Asianet, a major ISP in the state, and their website proudly exhibits an appreciation by an Asianet ofﬁcial on the effectiveness of the antivirus support they have given. Linuxense ran a server break-in challenge during March 9-13, and won. No one was able to break into the server they had set up for the purpose. Swatantra Software Solutions and Services (abbreviated to S2S2) is a small business in Kannur that has been involved in selling Free Software CDs and systems with GNU/Linux, and providing assistance to schools for installing computers and networks using GNU/Linux. Sujeevan, who runs the company, actively promotes Free Software and has participated in training sessions for teachers organised by the Teachers' Association and by FSFI. He has also helped in installing the customised GNU/Linux distribution for schools in existing networked computer labs in some schools. There are several companies that do business using Free Software along with other platforms -InApp Technologies, for instance. But I have not been able to identify one that does software development/support exclusively using Free Software. Free Software Free Society Free Software Free Society is the name of a collection of articles written by Richard Stallman. It was very appropriate that this name was chosen for a conference organised in Thiruvananthapuram by SPACE, FSF India, and others, because this conference, as the press release by the organisers stated, “explores the possibilities of applying the Free Software model in addressing broader questions such as Governance, Digital Inclusion, Development and Culture.” The conference was supported by Hipatia(a European NGO), Kerala State IT Mission, Free Software Foundation of India, and the Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, Kerala (IIITM-K), Thiruvananthapuram. The conference had its origins at the World Social Forum held in Mumbai during Jan 16-21, 2004. Arun met some people from Hipatia, which also worked for promoting Free Software and its philosophy, at the venue. They agreed that there was a need for people from countries that are geographically far apart, such as India and Latin America, to come together and share their ideas about Free Software so that something fruitful could evolve. This idea evoked a lot of interest in countries as varied as Brazil, Venezuela, Italy and India, and the Government of Kerala agreed to extend support for such a conference. The website of the conference explained the vision of the conference: Located at the intersection of Free Software, Development and Society, the FSFS Conference will examine the application of the Free Software model for equitable sharing models for intellectual artifacts, and ultimately for human development. The conference will also address, inter alia, issues such as technology access and the digital divide; legal issues; and experiences of using the Free Software model in ﬁelds such as music and literature. The conference was held in the beautiful campus of the Technopark at Thiruvananthapuram during May 28-31, 2004. Felipe Perez-Marti, eminent economist and ex-Minister of Venezuela delivered the keynote address. Another important participant was Senator Fiorello Cortiana from Italy. At the end of the conference, it adopted a declaration, now known as the Thiruvananthapuram Declaration. It called upon the “social and political institutions to eliminate systems that hinder the development of the gnowledge society (see www.gnowledge.org).”13 Conclusion We saw how Free Software has come to stay in Kerala. The natural question this raises is, “Why Kerala?” There is no other state in the country where Free Software has made an impact that is anywhere near that in Kerala. This itself could be the subject for an entire thesis, and this is certainly not the place to enter into a serious analysis of the question. However, an article like this cannot totally ignore the question either. Therefore, an attempt, however feeble, is made here to answer that question. When one talks of the state of Kerala, what comes to one's mind is the special place that it occupies in the country and the very different development path that the state has followed. Kerala is different from India as a whole in many ways: literacy rate in Kerala is about 90%, while the average for India is about 52%; life expectancy at birth in Kerala is 73 years compare to 61 years in India; Kerala's birth rate is 14 per 1000 females, while India's rate is 25. Kerala has one of the lowest ratios of disabled persons to service units-5,000, compared to the highest values of 17,000 in some states. Women outnumber men, live longer, are as educated as men and they dominate some occupations like school teachers. In spite of the small population of the state, it has produced some of the outstanding writers, cinematographers, cartoonists and journalists in the country. The Physical Quality of Life Index for the state is comparable to that in developed countries. At the same time, alcoholism, suicide rate, and drug abuse are close to the highest in the country. Wages are much higher than in the neighbouring states. Almost every other family has someone working abroad or in the IT industry in one of the major metropolises. “It is, in other words, weird-like one of those places where the starship Enterprise might land that superﬁcially resembles Earth but is slightly off.” wrote Bill McKibben14. Kerala has a history of several social reform movements. One of the most prominent is that led by Sri Narayana Guru for the upliftment of the Ezhava community. Members of the community were barred from entering Hindu temples and even studying Sanskrit and the scriptures. He led a successful struggle against these and even established a temple himself. Ayyan Kali led a struggle against oppression of lower castes by upper caste people and the State. Mannath Padmanabhan led a movement by the middle level Nair community and established the Nair Service Society. The Kerala Sasthra Sahitya Parishad promoted scientiﬁc thinking among children and adults and also spearheaded the total literacy movement. The Communist Party helped to liberate workers from virtual slavery and to bring about universal education. The Christian missionaries that have been active in the state for several decades also helped to take basic education to even the most down-trodden. While this is the background, it is difﬁcult to understand why such things happened in Kerala but not in other states. The unique history of this land has helped create a unique sense of democracy, equity and social justice among the people in the state. This is evidenced by the sometimes violent reactions to events that are perceived as violation of basic rights. Police action against tribals who had occupied government land in protest against the government's inaction in providing them land as promised, and suicide of a student who could not continue her education due to inability to pay the fees, are two examples of events that led to major protests. Freedom is a concept close to their hearts and the sense of personal dignity is high. People thus ﬁnd it easy to perceive Free Software as a ﬁght against exploitation by large software companies. Moreover, the penetration of communication networks (telephone, mobile, Internet) is one of the highest in the country, and two of the highest circulated newspapers in the country are in the local language. Thus people are aware of happenings in other parts of the world. It is interesting that, in the 1970s, an eccentric ﬁlm maker, John Abraham, considered by many as possibly the only genius in Malayalam cinema, produced a ﬁlm Amma Ariyaan (which can be literally translated as For the knowledge of the mother), by collecting small donations and exhibited it everywhere free of charge. Like Knuth's TEX, this could be considered as a forerunner of Free Software, considering that the ideology of Free Software is being extended to creativity in other areas through movements like Creative Commons. Perhaps, it is no coincidence that the Free Software movement ﬂourished in Kerala. ------------------ Footnotes: 1 Those who would like to know more about Free Software can ﬁnd plenty of material at the FSF website. 2 A LaTeX is a set of macros for TeX that is now commonly used for typesetting, instead of plain TeX. 3 (http://sarovar.org) 4 InApp Technologies (http://www.inapp.com) 5 Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, Kerala 6 Emacs is the editor developed by Stallman that is very popular among users of Unix-like systems including GNU/Linux. 7 (http://www.linuxtoday.com/news story.php3?ltsn=2001-07-19-010-20-PR-CY) 8 GNOME is one of the various desktops available in GNU/Linux. 9 http://www.apdip.net/projects/malayalam/ 10 http://www.sutharya.kerala.gov.in/ 11 http://www.space-kerala.org/downloads/foss.pdf 12 www.linuxense.com 13 The full text of the declaration is available at fsfs.hipatia.net/wiki/index.php/Main Page. 14 http://www.ashanet.org/library/articles/kerala.199803.html ___________________________________________________________________________________ This document may be copied, distributed or republished in any media subject to the condition that this note is also included.

      "content": "Original Source My thoughts about Freedom and Free Software. Friday, August 31, 2007 The Story of Free Software in Kerala, India This is the story of Free Software in the state of Kerala in India. I wrote this for a book entitled Knowledge Society and Development -- Kerala Experience edited by Antony Palackal of Loyola College, Thiruvananthapuram, and Wesley Shrum of Louisiana State University. The article is published under a free license, as mentioned at the end of the article. I am putting a slightly modified version here so that any interested person can make use of it. Free Software in Kerala Dr. V. Sasi Kumar A friend, who had worked in Brazil for a couple of years, once told me, “Kerala is known in Latin America for Free Software.” This indicates the extent to which Kerala has dominated the Free Software scenario in India. It is not by chance that the headquarters of the Free Software Foundation of India happened to be situated at Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala. The state is now poised to become the ﬁrst in the country to introduce exclusively Free Software for IT education in high schools. We shall examine here how all this came about. But before that, we shall look at what the term Free Software1 means. Free Software is software that gives users freedom-four freedoms, to be precise. As the website of the Free Software Foundation (http://www.gnu.org) says: “Free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech”, not as in “free ice cream”. Free software is a matter of the users' freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. More precisely, it refers to four kinds of freedom, for the users of the software: • The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0). • The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this. • The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbour (freedom 2). • The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community beneﬁts (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition for this. Free Software began to be developed when Richard M. Stallman, a programmer with the Artiﬁcial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, resigned and started the GNU (recursive acronym for GNU is Not Unix) project in 1984. Later, he also started the Free Software Foundation (FSF). Today, there is a large volume of Free Software, and the most popular Free operating system is GNU/Linux (sometimes called simply Linux). We capitalise the F and S in Free Software to distinguish it from proprietary software that is distributed free of cost, sometimes called freeware. We shall also use the shortened form, FS. So, with that, we shall now take a look at the story of FS in Kerala. The story is bound to be biased by my experiences and limited by my knowledge. Individuals or organisations who have contributed to the Free Software movement in the state may have been left out from the narration, even though this is written after speaking to several people who were involved right from the beginning of the movement. I apologise for any such omissions and assure the readers that they are inadvertent and not deliberate. The Beginning The story apparently began with the introduction of TeX, the typesetting program that was designed in the 1970s by Donald Knuth, the author of The Art of Computer Programming, a four volume classic. TeX was introduced into Kerala by Prof. K.S.S. Namburipad of the Department of Mathematics in the University of Kerala. TeX could typeset mathematical equations very neatly, which no other software could do, especially in the 1980s when Prof. Namburipad brought TeX in fourteen ﬂoppy disks from the United States. He could bring the program and use it on a number of computers without any legal problem because it had no licences-it was in the public domain. It was, in a sense, the Grandmother of Free Software, as some people call it. Prof. Namburipad encouraged his students to learn and use TeX, especially for preparing their theses. One of his students was E. Krishnan, now with the Mathematics Department of the University College, Thiruvananthapuram, a leading exponent of TeX and one of the auA thors of the very popular LaTeX primer2 published as an electronic book by the Indian TeX User Group. Dr. Krishnan also played an important role in establishing the Free Software Foundation of India. Another person inspired by Prof. Namburipad was one C.V. Radhakrishnan who used to run a small centre that prepared theses for the research students of the Kariavattom campus of the University of Kerala. C.V. Radhakrishnan took serious interest in TeX. He found that there was business opportunity here and with virtually no competition. Eventually, he established a company in 1995, called River Valley Technologies, for doing typesetting of scientiﬁc papers and theses. He had his two brothers with him when he started the company. They used the DOS operating system running on Intel AT machines, along with Novell Netware for networking. Since Unix was rather expensive those days, they did not attempt to use it, though they were familiar with it. Around 1996, a computer vendor who supplied part of their systems suggested that they use Linux, which was very similar to Unix and was free. He also gave them a CD containing the Slackware distribution. It was around this period (March 1996) that the magazine PCQuest brought out CDs containing the Slackware distribution of GNU/Linux, the ﬁrst commercial distribution of the Free operating system. It was probably a copy of this CD that Radhakrishnan got from the vendor. Though the operating system was primitive in some ways, and installing it on a computer was a tough job, it came in handy for the new company. As Radhakrishnan says, “It was very difﬁcult to install Linux those days. It took us about one week to install it on one system. We could link it to Novell Netware since there was a tool for that. Later, we installed it on all machines and discarded Novell Netware.” River Valley Technologies thus took off as possibly the ﬁrst Free Software based company in the state and almost certainly as the ﬁrst TeX based company in the country. Since then, the company has been using GNU/Linux almost exclusively, except for one computer that still runs MS Windows mainly for opening MS Word ﬁles and for some editing of vector graphics for which Free alternatives are not sufﬁciently powerful now. Much of their work is automated so that human intervention is required only minimally. Today, Radhakrishnan is one of the top TeX programmers in the world. His company has seventy employees and their clients include the Institute of Physics, UK, Macmillan (Nature) and Elsevier. The company uses Free Software and also sponsors India's ﬁrst portal to host Free Software projects3. Meanwhile, Satish Babu, CEO of the South Indian Federation of Fishermen's Societies (SIFFS), was using the new technology of the Internet to enhance the efﬁciency of his organisation. He learnt about the Internet when he went to the Hull International Fisheries Institute, UK, in 1993 for training in ﬁsheries management, and he became highly interested in the technology. Though basically a management expert trained at the prestigious Institute of Rural Management, Anand, his interest in the technology prompted him to study computers and programming in depth and virtually made him a programmer. Today he is involved in running a software company4 in the Technopark at Thiruvananthapuram and is actively involved with bodies like the Computer Society of India and the Indian chapter of the Institution of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. He is the Executive Secretary of the Society for Promotion of Alternative Computing and Employment (SPACE), an NGO promoting Free Software, and is an active member of FSF India. After his return from the UK, he started using computers to improve the efficiency of the organisation he was working for. He learnt that email was being implemented through the Ernet network which used VSAT technology at that time. Leo Fernandez of the Indian Social Institute, Bangalore, with which Satish already had links, helped him to link to the Ernet node in Bangalore through a telephone dial-up connection. This was in 1994. Satish conﬁgured his computer to dial-up in the early morning hours when telephone call rates were lowest, and send and receive mails. Though this was slow by today's standards, since an exchange of mails would take at least two days, it was enormously faster than using the postal service. Part of the software he used for this was actually Free Software, though he was not aware of it at that time. It was again Leo Fernandez who introduced him to Linux in 1995. Though not very conﬁdent about the new system, Satish and his friends soon grew to like it, especially since there were a lot of things one could do at the system level. As Satish says, “Once you learn to tinker around with the system, you really start enjoying it and it becomes a habit that is difﬁcult to get over.” And GNU/Linux offered plenty of opportunities for such people. But Satish and friends were still not very much aware of the ideology of Free Software and its implications. His ﬁrst distribution of GNU/Linux, known as Slackware, was given to Satish by Leo Fernandez. Soon, SIFFS organised a training programme in GNU/Linux by Leo. In 1998, Radhakrishnan, Krishnan, Namburipad, Satish and others decided to set up a Linux User Group (LUG) in Thiruvananthapuram. Others associated with this included journalist K.G. Kumar, computer science student M. Arun, and P.M. Sasi, who was with the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC), Thiruvananthapuram. M. Arun was a student of Computer Science at the College of Engineering, Thiruvananthapuram, when his father bought a computer from Keltron (in fact, the ﬁrst computer Keltron sold). This had an operating system developed by IBM known as OS2. As Arun says, “This was much better than Windows 95, which was popular at that time.” One of his friends had got a Packard-Bell computer with MS Windows from the US and wanted to install Linux in it. Arun had a copy of the PC Quest Slackware CD and undertook the job of installing it in the machine. It installed neatly without any problem. So he decided to try it on his computer. But the result was disappointing. He could not get the graphical interface running. One of his friends suggested that he try the Red Hat distribution, and Arun wrote to a company, GTL Enterprises in Bangalore, for a copy of the Red Hat CD. They replied asking him to contact the local Linux User Group, which C.V. Radhakrishnan and others had just started. Arun went to Radhakrishnan's ofﬁce with his friend Amit and not only obtained the CD but also joined the LUG. They started having weekly meetings. Arun found that a few teachers in their college were interested in GNU/Linux. They got the college to purchase some manuals from FSF, Boston. Arun and a few of his friends had read about the ideology of Free Software and were attracted by it. In 1999, Wros Publishers organised a conference called Bang! Linux in Bangalore. Arun and a few other students went for the conference. Richard M. Stallman (known by his initials RMS), the founder of the GNU project and the Free Software Foundation, was there. This was his ﬁrst meeting in India and his lecture impressed the students from Kerala. They came back thoroughly convinced about the ideology of Free Software. Today, Arun is the secretary of the Free Software Foundation of India and is also the co-ordinator of SPACE. With the new millennium came the group known as Free Developers. This was started by one Tony Stanco, an advocate from the US, who proposed that they start a company that would do business using Free Software and eventually make it the leading software globally. He had corresponded with RMS about his ideas. Though RMS was sceptical about the feasibility of the project, Tony went ahead with it and managed to obtain support from a number of people, including C.V. Radhakrishnan, Arun and others in Kerala. This initiative helped in developing the dotGNU project, which was a free substitute for Microsoft's .NET, since several people from India joined the project. The discussions in the Thiruvananthapuram LUG soon led to the ideology of Free Software, which the members found attractive. They discussed the idea of establishing a Free Software Foundation of India, and a unit of Free Developers. FSF India, they hoped, would act to supervise the ethical aspects of Free Developers. Radhakrishnan got in touch with Richard Stallman and got his approval for starting FSF India, and got him to agree to inaugurate FSF India. Satish Babu, who was then the Regional Vice-President of the Computer Society of India, took the initiative to organise the inaugural function. It was decided to inaugurate the Indian branch of Free Developers also at the same function. Freedom First The conference organised at Thiruvananthapuram in connection with the inauguration of Free Software Foundation of India was aptly called Freedom First. The name was suggested by the journalist K.G. Kumar and it must have immediately struck a chord with the others. Richard Stallman was the chief guest for the conference, and he was received as an honoured state guest by government ofﬁcials to discuss the philosophy behind the movement. The Organising Committee formed to conduct the conference included Radhakrishnan, Satish Babu, Arun, Krishnan, Rajkumar (who runs a Free Software business), P.M. Sasi, K.G. Kumar, Dr. K.R. Srivathsan (Director, IIITMK5), and others. The function in the morning, in which FSF India was inaugurated by Stallman, was chaired by the Secretary to the Government, Information Technology Department. About 300 people from all over the state and even outside were present, ﬁlling the auditorium beyond its capacity. “Computer users in India, as elsewhere, deserve the freedom to share and change software, the way cooks share and change recipes. So I am pleased to inaugurate the Free Software Foundation of India, which will promote the use and the development of free software in this country”, Stallman told the gathering. Later, he met the Minister for Information Technology and held discussions on promoting Free Software in the state. The afternoon session was devoted to the inauguration of Free Developers India and some technical presentations. There were a couple of interesting moments during Stallman's visit. At the airport, a number of people were curious to see a ﬁgure with long hair and long beard and wanted to know who he was. When he understood what they were asking, he introduced himself, “I am Saint IGNUcious of the church of Emacs.”6 Possibly, some people took that seriously! There was a poignant moment when Stallman was going to a hotel for lunch along with a few other people. One of them told Stallman that Nelson Mandela had signed a Freedom Declaration that had been put up at the Free Developers website. “RMS just couldn't believe that and he almost cried. He said Mandela had always been his hero.” wrote Ramakrishnan (one of the others in the vehicle) later. When someone tried to compare Stallman with Mandela, RMS retorted that whatever he has done could never be compared with the 25 years in prison that Mandela had suffered. It was an achievement of FS enthusiasts in the state that the government agreed to support the event and treat RMS as a state guest. As a report in Linux Today7 said: Government ofﬁcials and other Free Software supporters in the state of Kerala believe that Free Software meshes particularly well with Kerala's long tradition of democracy, equity and public action. Just as Kerala is often held up as a model of equitable social and human development in the region, Free Software supporters there believe they can leverage the inherent freedoms of Free Software to evolve an equitable Knowledge Society based on software independence and self- reliance. The conference was a great success in many ways. It attracted a lot of media attention and made 'Free Software' and Richard Stallman' popular among the public. Advocacy There have been a few instances where the Free Software community was able to inﬂuence decision makers to choose Free Software over proprietary. In some cases, the decisive breakthrough was achieved by individual effort, while in some cases, it was a community effort. We shall look into two cases here, that of the implementation of a network by the Public Works Department and that of the introduction of IT education in schools. PWD Network One of the ﬁrst successful campaigns for Free Software was in the Public Works Department of the state. InApp Technologies, the company started by Satish Babu, Amarnath Raja and others, was asked to make a proposal for a PWD project by one of the Secretaries of the PWD. InApp made it clear that while they do work with all technologies, they would quote only for a Free platform, as they considered it as most appropriate for any e-governance project. The consultant to the Kerala Transportation Project, under which the application was being planned, felt that he did not know sufﬁciently about Free Software, and obtained quotes from Microsoft and Oracle. However, the Secretary concerned knew about InApp and suggested to the Principal Secretary that InApp's proposal should be considered seriously. A debate was therefore organised to (a) explain what Free Software was, and (b) what its advantages were over proprietary platforms. This debate was conducted by the then PWD Principal Secretary and was attended by two other Secretaries, the consultant to the Transportation Project, some Chief Engineers and senior people from the PWD. Two people from Microsoft, one from Oracle, Amarnath Raja and Satish formed the participants. Satish was armed with a survey conducted among Technopark companies about their perceptions on Free Software in December 2002 (http://gtechindia.org/jsp/survey.pdf), which was conducted by Satish who was the GTech Treasurer. The study had clearly shown the features of Free Software that made it attractive especially for e-governance projects. Microsoft came prepared with their “sponsored research” ﬁndings. Since Satish and Amarnath were prepared for it, they were easily able to refute their ﬁndings. Microsoft possibly did not expect this, and perhaps had thought that this would be a walkover. The person from Oracle was unaware of the local politics and looked surprised by the ferocity of the debate. He started off pro-Microsoft, but shifted to the Free Software camp half-way through. The Secretaries were convinced about the need to go Free, and InApp got the order. The application was delivered and is running well. IT@School Project Another successful campaign, which was driven by a large number of FS enthusiasts and received much more publicity, was that for the inclusion of Free Software in IT education in schools. The Department of Education, Government of Kerala, started a project called IT@School for bringing IT enabled education to the high schools in the state. The project constituted a committee headed by Prof. U.R. Rao, former Chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation, to make recommendations on the direction the project should take. After studying the status of education in the state and elaborate discussions, the Committee recommended that the project should aim to bring IT to high schools in the state to empower teachers and to use the technology for improving curriculum transaction in the classes. However, the project found that most of the teachers and the students possessed little IT skills. They, therefore, decided to start IT education at the high school level initially. IT was thus introduced in the eighth standard in the year 2002 after conducting training in IT for a large number of teachers. The teacher training was organised using help from the Intel Teach to the Future programme, and their course material, which was wholly based on Microsoft software, was used for the training. Struggle for Free Software The textbook for IT prepared by the State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT) was based purely on Microsoft Windows and other Microsoft applications like MS Ofﬁce. The Free Software community in the state found this very offensive, since it ignored the existence of Free Software and promoted the products of one company ignoring even other proprietary software. The community responded by talking to people, sending letters, writing in the media and so on. The Free Software User Group in Kochi prepared a memorandum and sent it to several people involved in the matter, including the Directors of the IT@School project and SCERT, the Director of Public Instruction, the Principal Secretary, Education Department, and the Secretary, IT Department. They pointed out that: • IT@School was promoting the software of one company at the cost of software produced by everyone else; • the government would have to pay an enormous amount for licencing the software for the schools; • even if the company gives the software for the schools free of cost, it is only a marketing ploy in order to reap beneﬁts of having a pool of people who are familiar with their software packages and thus form an assured customer base, either as users themselves or as potential skilled employees; • the Government's approach would result in compelling not only schools, but also the general public to purchase software from this particular vendor in the future. This would create a monopoly in favour of that corporation and expose the public, the State and the nation to the mercy of a single company; • the corporation, whose brands and products are prescribed in the syllabus, does not publish the standards used in their software. This practice compels other people who have to interact with users of the products of this corporation (like the government and schools, in this case) to purchase software from this particular vendor only-a situation known as 'vendor lock-in'; • the government is promoting illegal copying and installation of software in the computers in the schools by not providing for software costs; • handling licencing issues is not simple and there has been at least one instance in which a school in the US had to pay $ 300,000 as ﬁne-even screenshots used in textbooks may have to be licenced; • several software packages, both applications as well as operating systems, which conform to industry-wide standards, adopted and maintained by independent vendors, and with less restrictive licences, are available. The Kerala School Teachers Association decided to throw its weight behind the demand from Free Software enthusiasts. The government and the IT@School project were still not willing to change. However, due to pressure from several directions, SCERT decided to incorporate Free Software also in the textbook and rewrote the textbook for the eighth standard for the academic year 2003-04. Sri N.K. Satyapalan, who was the person in charge of IT education at the State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT) played an important role in pushing Free Software into the textbook. Some schools, especially in northern Kerala, where there were teachers who knew how to install and use GNU/Linux, installed it and started IT classes using it. In order to ensure that all schools did buy sufﬁcient computers and taught IT, it was also decided to include IT as an additional subject and conduct examinations, though with less marks than other subjects. Computerised Examination An important phase started when the IT@School project decided to conduct part of the IT examination using a software. They developed a software called Softexam for conducting the examination. This was designed primarily for the MS Windows platform and some of the schools using GNU/Linux had to install MS Windows to enable the software. There was immediate protest from the Teachers Association and the Project was forced to develop Softexam for GNU/Linux also. However, this is now being virtually discontinued, with the software being conﬁned to presenting previously prepared questions randomly and saving the responses for later evaluation by teachers. One problem with using GNU/Linux was that there were several distributions of the OS, each slightly different from the others, and schools had installed different distributions. Even preparing the textbook became difﬁcult, since the screenshots, and sometimes even the procedures for using the software, could be different for different distributions. To solve this problem, the Free Software Foundation of India suggested developing a custom distribution for IT@School, and eventually created the distribution with funding from the Kerala State IT Mission. Another problem that the IT@School project faced was that of providing support to the schools where GNU/Linux was being used. They called for private agencies who were willing to provide support to register with them. A number of agencies, including Free Software User Groups, responded and about twenty of them were short listed. A ﬁnal solution to the problem came when SPACE (mentioned earlier) decided to offer support to IT@School, both in terms of updating the distribution used in schools and in providing support to the teacher community. The website of SPACE now has provided for teachers to post questions there, to which experts will respond, and also a page listing the Frequently Asked Questions and the answers to them. The IT@School project arranged for teachers to be trained in GNU/Linux and a majority of teachers have already been trained. A Resource Centre has been established in Kochi for conducting teacher training with technical assistance from SPACE. In 2005, the government announced that the schools in Kerala will completely switch to Free Software in stages. Supplements to the textbooks were created to enable students to study using GNU/Linux, which also introduced some software that a child new to computers could use to learn the skills needed to use a mouse and a keyboard. Tuxpaint, a simple painting software, which a child could use even if (s)he was unfamiliar with the intricacies of saving or retrieving a ﬁle, and Gcompris, a set of games that helped the child to learn how to use the mouse and keyboard, became very popular with children. The textbooks for all the three classes in high school are now being revised to contain Free Software exclusively. Kerala is poised to become the ﬁrst state in the country to use exclusively Free Software in its schools. It is also poised to become possible the ﬁrst state to introduce IT enabled education in high schools in a big way. Visits by Stallman Richard Stallman, founder of the GNU project and FSF, has visited India several times and given lectures in several states. But the state he has visited most often is Kerala, probably because of the large support in this state for his ideology. The ﬁrst time Stallman visited Kerala was for the Freedom First conference in 2001. His next visit was in connection with the EMS Memorial Lecture constituted by Kerala University. Stallman spoke about the danger of software patents at the University Senate Hall on January 24, 2004. The same day he spoke about copyright law and freedom in science at Centre for Earth Science Studies. Both lectures were well attended and there were a number of questions from the audience at both venues. On Independence Day, he interacted with the students of the Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management Kerala (IIITMK). During this visit, Stallman also met the then leader of the Opposition (present Chief Minister) V.S. Achuthanandan, who has been a strong supporter of the Free Software movement, and held discussions on how the government can support and beneﬁt from Free Software. Richard Stallman's latest visit to Kerala has been in August this year (2006). SPACE in association with Kerala State IT Mission conducted a seminar on Free Software for Kerala Development on the 23rd of August. Stallman gave the keynote address in this seminar. The seminar was inaugurated by the Chief Minister, who had a long discussion with Stallman. A report on Free Software Projects in Public Enterprises in Kerala, prepared by SPACE, was released at the function. Stallman was in India to participate in the GPL v3 conference at Bangalore on August 25 and 26. Development A certain amount of Free Software development was done in the state even in the initial days. This includes localisation of the GNOME8 Desktop (that is, making the desktop available in the local language, Malayalam), a project monitoring application for the government and a portal for enhancing transparency in everyday activities of the government. The localisation work was started by Arun and his friends Gopal, Sreekrishna and others soon after the establishment of FSF India. The Managing Director of Keltron, an undertaking of the Government of Kerala, offered to help them in their effort. The idea was that the government and other users could be provided a platform in Malayalam for their uses. They managed to get support from Asia-Paciﬁc Development Information Programme (APDIP), an initiative developed and funded by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), for the work. “Speciﬁcally, the project aims to create Free Font for Malayalam, create toolkit (toolkits are basic building blocks in creating Graphical User Interface based applications) with Malayalam support, and create a localised desktop and ofﬁce productivity applications and documentation in Malayalam.”, says the project abstract9 . The work was undertaken by the Kerala Bureau for Industrial Promotion (KBIP) in association with FSF India. All menu and other text, like messages, were translated into Malayalam so that a person who knows only Malayalam could comfortably use a computer with the customised GNOME desktop. Unfortunately, the work was never released to the public because of ofﬁcial apathy. Another Free Software based development was in connection with the Modernising Government Programme (MGP). MGP was drawn up as part of the strategy of the Government to overhaul and improve its services to the people of the State. One of the components of MGP was monitoring projects funded by the government. The Program Performance monitoring system (PPMS) was developed by Keltron (Kerala State Electronics Development Corporation) for tracking the performance of various departments as part of MGP. PPMS contain 4 major projects. The ﬁrst project, PPMS1, is a performance monitoring system for 17 government departments. It covers a total of 93 initiatives of these departments, 50 of them in the ﬁrst phase. The system uses result base management methods to measure performance based on impacts, outputs, outcomes & activities. PPMS2 is a set of service delivery projects. It addresses performance monitoring of 2584 institutions statewide like schools and community health centres and mainly deals with fund ﬂow management, administrative payment orders etc. The Third project is a human resource module named e-bandham. It monitors attendance, leave, travel allowances etc of the program support executives. The fourth project is Sevanamudra, Quality Improvement Program & Performance Certiﬁcation Mechanism for government institutions. Another project done using Free Software is Sutharya Keralam, or Transparent Kerala. This is a Right to Information initiative of the Government of Kerala to ensure transparency and efﬁciency in everyday functions of the government. “The major objectives of the project are the automation of Chief Minister's Grievance Redressal Cell and convergence of all the available forms of Communication so as to guarantee People's Right to Information.”, says its website10. The project was developed completely on Free Software technologies by the Centre for Development of Imaging Technologies (CDIT), an institute under the Government of Kerala. Other Free Software projects in the state include computerisation of the ofﬁces of milk producers unions in the state that come under the Kerala State Milk Marketing Federation (Milma), a Management Information System for the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) developed by CDAC, a District Collectorate Suite developed by the National Informatics Centre and a computerisation project of Calicut University done inhouse. A study on Free Software projects in public enterprises in Kerala has been done by SPACE and is available online11. SPACE The Society for Promotion of Alternative Computing and Employment, or SPACE, is a society promoted by Kerala State IT Mission with the objective of promoting alternative computing, that is, Free, Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS). It has a government nominee in its Board of Directors and has support from professional societies (such as IEEE and the Computer Society of India) and the academia. It had as its ﬁrst Chairman the then Vice Chancellor of the University of Kerala, Dr. B. Ekbal, and members included Satish Babu, Amarnath Raja, P.M. Sasi and C.V. Radhakrishnan. Though it came into existence in 2003, it could not undertake much activity due to lack of funds. This problem was solved when SPACE entered into a tie-up with SOMA for working on joint projects. SPACE became active with the setting up of an ofﬁce and recruiting a few people. Activities started in areas like promoting Virtual Micro Enterprises (VMEs) based on Free Software, advocating FS in colleges and setting up Free Software Cells where feasible, helping in training school teachers in FS, and so on. Some of the achievements of SPACE did attract considerable media attention. One example is the development of a distribution of GNU/Linux speciﬁcally for electronics laboratories in engineering colleges. This was made available on one CD, and was named Free Electron. The distribution was created by the FS Cell in an engineering college in Thiruvananthapuram with help from SPACE. There were a number of requests from colleges inside and outside the state, and even one from abroad. Another distribution that SPACE created for system recovery purposes was distributed by a local IT magazine. A workshop SPACE conducted, in collaboration with another NGO (Mediact) involved in media education, at a village library for creating and publishing a village newsletter in Malayalam also attracted much interest. Another programme that became popularly known was the initiative for setting up a radio station for ﬁsherfolk. Started on the initiative of a few young people from the ﬁshing community in Thiruvananthapuram, Radio Alakal, as it was called, could not start regular broadcast due to some licencing issues, but started narrowcasting (using loud speakers at speciﬁc locations). All the work for Radio Alakal was done using Free Software. SPACE also helped the IT@School project to set up a teacher training centre in Kochi.Free SoFree Software in Businessftware in Business Free Software in Business There are several companies in the state doing business using Free Software. We mentioned River Valley Technologies of Radhakrishnan. Another enterprise in Kochi, Beta Computers, also does business using TeX. An organisation worth mentioning is the Open Software Solutions Industrial Co-operative Society in Kochi. It is a cooperative effort which consists of some young programmers who were involved with the Ernakulam Industrial Infrastructure Development Project. The project started work for computerising the Panchayats (local self-government institution) in the district. They used only Free Software and computerised a few Panchayats. However, the state-wide programme called Information Kerala Mission for the same purpose, which used only proprietary software, superseded their efforts. The youth involved in the project started a co-operative society and started doing business with Free Software. They developed a software for co-operative banks, called Sanghamitra, which has been installed in a number of branches. This is also licenced under the GNU General Public Licence. They have been developing software for other purposes also, and are doing reasonably well. Rajkumar (whose name has been mentioned earlier) runs a business called Linuxense at Thiruvananthapuram. “We are a GNU/Linux-based Enterprise providing software solutions of exceptional quality using cutting-edge technologies; creating a GNU/Linux ambiance for our distinguished clients in their demanding work environments.” says their website12 . They provide support for Asianet, a major ISP in the state, and their website proudly exhibits an appreciation by an Asianet ofﬁcial on the effectiveness of the antivirus support they have given. Linuxense ran a server break-in challenge during March 9-13, and won. No one was able to break into the server they had set up for the purpose. Swatantra Software Solutions and Services (abbreviated to S2S2) is a small business in Kannur that has been involved in selling Free Software CDs and systems with GNU/Linux, and providing assistance to schools for installing computers and networks using GNU/Linux. Sujeevan, who runs the company, actively promotes Free Software and has participated in training sessions for teachers organised by the Teachers' Association and by FSFI. He has also helped in installing the customised GNU/Linux distribution for schools in existing networked computer labs in some schools. There are several companies that do business using Free Software along with other platforms -InApp Technologies, for instance. But I have not been able to identify one that does software development/support exclusively using Free Software. Free Software Free Society Free Software Free Society is the name of a collection of articles written by Richard Stallman. It was very appropriate that this name was chosen for a conference organised in Thiruvananthapuram by SPACE, FSF India, and others, because this conference, as the press release by the organisers stated, “explores the possibilities of applying the Free Software model in addressing broader questions such as Governance, Digital Inclusion, Development and Culture.” The conference was supported by Hipatia(a European NGO), Kerala State IT Mission, Free Software Foundation of India, and the Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, Kerala (IIITM-K), Thiruvananthapuram. The conference had its origins at the World Social Forum held in Mumbai during Jan 16-21, 2004. Arun met some people from Hipatia, which also worked for promoting Free Software and its philosophy, at the venue. They agreed that there was a need for people from countries that are geographically far apart, such as India and Latin America, to come together and share their ideas about Free Software so that something fruitful could evolve. This idea evoked a lot of interest in countries as varied as Brazil, Venezuela, Italy and India, and the Government of Kerala agreed to extend support for such a conference. The website of the conference explained the vision of the conference: Located at the intersection of Free Software, Development and Society, the FSFS Conference will examine the application of the Free Software model for equitable sharing models for intellectual artifacts, and ultimately for human development. The conference will also address, inter alia, issues such as technology access and the digital divide; legal issues; and experiences of using the Free Software model in ﬁelds such as music and literature. The conference was held in the beautiful campus of the Technopark at Thiruvananthapuram during May 28-31, 2004. Felipe Perez-Marti, eminent economist and ex-Minister of Venezuela delivered the keynote address. Another important participant was Senator Fiorello Cortiana from Italy. At the end of the conference, it adopted a declaration, now known as the Thiruvananthapuram Declaration. It called upon the “social and political institutions to eliminate systems that hinder the development of the gnowledge society (see www.gnowledge.org).”13 Conclusion We saw how Free Software has come to stay in Kerala. The natural question this raises is, “Why Kerala?” There is no other state in the country where Free Software has made an impact that is anywhere near that in Kerala. This itself could be the subject for an entire thesis, and this is certainly not the place to enter into a serious analysis of the question. However, an article like this cannot totally ignore the question either. Therefore, an attempt, however feeble, is made here to answer that question. When one talks of the state of Kerala, what comes to one's mind is the special place that it occupies in the country and the very different development path that the state has followed. Kerala is different from India as a whole in many ways: literacy rate in Kerala is about 90%, while the average for India is about 52%; life expectancy at birth in Kerala is 73 years compare to 61 years in India; Kerala's birth rate is 14 per 1000 females, while India's rate is 25. Kerala has one of the lowest ratios of disabled persons to service units-5,000, compared to the highest values of 17,000 in some states. Women outnumber men, live longer, are as educated as men and they dominate some occupations like school teachers. In spite of the small population of the state, it has produced some of the outstanding writers, cinematographers, cartoonists and journalists in the country. The Physical Quality of Life Index for the state is comparable to that in developed countries. At the same time, alcoholism, suicide rate, and drug abuse are close to the highest in the country. Wages are much higher than in the neighbouring states. Almost every other family has someone working abroad or in the IT industry in one of the major metropolises. “It is, in other words, weird-like one of those places where the starship Enterprise might land that superﬁcially resembles Earth but is slightly off.” wrote Bill McKibben14. Kerala has a history of several social reform movements. One of the most prominent is that led by Sri Narayana Guru for the upliftment of the Ezhava community. Members of the community were barred from entering Hindu temples and even studying Sanskrit and the scriptures. He led a successful struggle against these and even established a temple himself. Ayyan Kali led a struggle against oppression of lower castes by upper caste people and the State. Mannath Padmanabhan led a movement by the middle level Nair community and established the Nair Service Society. The Kerala Sasthra Sahitya Parishad promoted scientiﬁc thinking among children and adults and also spearheaded the total literacy movement. The Communist Party helped to liberate workers from virtual slavery and to bring about universal education. The Christian missionaries that have been active in the state for several decades also helped to take basic education to even the most down-trodden. While this is the background, it is difﬁcult to understand why such things happened in Kerala but not in other states. The unique history of this land has helped create a unique sense of democracy, equity and social justice among the people in the state. This is evidenced by the sometimes violent reactions to events that are perceived as violation of basic rights. Police action against tribals who had occupied government land in protest against the government's inaction in providing them land as promised, and suicide of a student who could not continue her education due to inability to pay the fees, are two examples of events that led to major protests. Freedom is a concept close to their hearts and the sense of personal dignity is high. People thus ﬁnd it easy to perceive Free Software as a ﬁght against exploitation by large software companies. Moreover, the penetration of communication networks (telephone, mobile, Internet) is one of the highest in the country, and two of the highest circulated newspapers in the country are in the local language. Thus people are aware of happenings in other parts of the world. It is interesting that, in the 1970s, an eccentric ﬁlm maker, John Abraham, considered by many as possibly the only genius in Malayalam cinema, produced a ﬁlm Amma Ariyaan (which can be literally translated as For the knowledge of the mother), by collecting small donations and exhibited it everywhere free of charge. Like Knuth's TEX, this could be considered as a forerunner of Free Software, considering that the ideology of Free Software is being extended to creativity in other areas through movements like Creative Commons. Perhaps, it is no coincidence that the Free Software movement ﬂourished in Kerala. ------------------ Footnotes: 1 Those who would like to know more about Free Software can ﬁnd plenty of material at the FSF website. 2 A LaTeX is a set of macros for TeX that is now commonly used for typesetting, instead of plain TeX. 3 (http://sarovar.org) 4 InApp Technologies (http://www.inapp.com) 5 Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, Kerala 6 Emacs is the editor developed by Stallman that is very popular among users of Unix-like systems including GNU/Linux. 7 (http://www.linuxtoday.com/news story.php3?ltsn=2001-07-19-010-20-PR-CY) 8 GNOME is one of the various desktops available in GNU/Linux. 9 http://www.apdip.net/projects/malayalam/ 10 http://www.sutharya.kerala.gov.in/ 11 http://www.space-kerala.org/downloads/foss.pdf 12 www.linuxense.com 13 The full text of the declaration is available at fsfs.hipatia.net/wiki/index.php/Main Page. 14 http://www.ashanet.org/library/articles/kerala.199803.html ___________________________________________________________________________________ This document may be copied, distributed or republished in any media subject to the condition that this note is also included.

      "content": "Linux Gaming Want to try linux, but worried about your games? Here's a guide to help you get started with gaming on linux. AfthabEK ProtonDB The unavailability of gaming options on Linux has long been a significant deterrent for Windows users considering the switch. For years, this has remained a prevalent issue. A few months ago, even I considered committing blasphemy and reverting to Windows, as I was unable to play my favorite games. However, recent developments such as the introduction of the Steam Deck—Valve’s latest gaming console based on Linux—and the emergence of Proton, a gaming environment, alongside major improvements in Wine, have effectively addressed this long-standing concern. After testing Genshin Impact, a popular AAA title, on my PC, I can confidently attest that my gaming experience on Linux has been on par, if not superior to my previous Windows gaming experience. The Steam Deck - Our Savior The Steam Deck, designed by Valve, is a pivotal milestone in Linux gaming. Its integration with Linux-based SteamOS and optimized gaming capabilities has significantly contributed to showcasing the potential of gaming on this platform. With Valve’s backing and support, Linux gaming has gained substantial traction, prompting further developments and support from game developers. Proton, a compatibility layer developed by Valve, enables the use of Windows games on Linux. It’s based on Wine, a compatibility layer that allows Windows applications to run on Linux. Proton’s integration with Steam has made it incredibly easy to install and play Windows games on Linux. While Proton is still in its early stages, it has already proven to be a viable solution for gaming on Linux. Flatpak - A way out of dependency hell Previously, configuring exact system requirements, drivers, and dependency versions for Wine and Proton posed a significant challenge. However, the advent of Flatpaks has simplified this process considerably. Flatpaks offer a solution by enabling the use of official app versions directly from developers, utilizing the intended dependencies on any Linux distribution. Setting up Flatpak across various distributions like Debian, Arch, Fedora, Ubuntu, and Manjaro has become relatively straightforward, ensuring a consistent experience across different Linux platforms. The alternative to Flatpak is Snap, which is a similar package manager. However, Snap is not as widely supported as Flatpak, and it’s not officially supported on Debian-based distributions. As a result, I recommend using Flatpak for the best experience. ProtonDB - A database for compatibility Due to the advent of steam deck, a lot of games are now being ported to Linux. You can check for the games directly supported on the GNU/Linux platform by searching on ProtonDB. ProtonDB is a community-driven database that provides information on the compatibility of Windows games with Linux. It also provides a rating for each game based on the user’s experience. This information is incredibly useful for determining whether a game is compatible with Linux and the potential performance issues that may arise. Lutris While it’s plausible to manually install all necessary software dependencies, using a gaming platform like Lutris significantly streamlines the process and minimizes hassle. To avoid potential dependency issues, I recommend installing Lutris via Flatpak. After installing Lutris, accessing and installing games becomes very straightforward. Simply navigate to lutris.net, search for your desired game, choose an install script, and follow the provided instructions for installation. I’ll be using Genshin Impact as an example. Genshin Impact is a popular free-to-play action role-playing game developed by Hoyoverse. I know some of you might judge me for playing this game, but we can debate on that later. It’s available on Windows, PlayStation, Android, and iOS. While it’s not officially supported on Linux, it can be installed and played using Lutris as a flatpak. To install Genshin Impact, Search Genshin impact on lutris.net, and select the latest install script. Then, click on the install button to install the game. After the installation is complete, you can launch the game from the Lutris library. After playing Genshin Impact for a month without experiencing a single frame drop, I can confidently say that my gaming experience on Linux has been on par, if not superior to my previous Windows gaming experience. While I can’t pinpoint the exact reason, it seems that WINE’s emulation of Windows might actually outperform Windows itself! You can also use other applications like Heroic Games Launcher, which is a native Linux client for the Epic Games Store. It’s still in its early stages, but it’s a promising alternative to Lutris. If you’re a fan of retro games, you can also use RetroArch, which is a frontend for emulators, game engines, and media players. It’s available on Flatpak. I’ve also tried out playing witcher 3 on my setup, although not for that long, and I’m getting 60 FPS at ultra settings, without any frame drops. This is the same performance I was getting on Windows 11, so I’m pretty happy with that. Conclusion With the exception of games that use Kernel-level anti-cheat software(Valorant smh), it’s possible to run almost any game on Linux, without any notable performance issues. All in all, Linux gaming has undergone a remarkable transformation, thanks to advancements in compatibility layers, dedicated gaming platforms, and the active support of the community. With these recent advancements, GNU/Linux can now be seens as a viable and compelling choice for gamers seeking a reliable and efficient gaming experience.

The public availability of the source code is, therefore, a necessary but not sufficient condition. FOSS is an inclusive umbrella term for free software and open-source software. FOSS is in contrast to proprietary software, where the software is under restrictive copyright or licensing and the source code is hidden from the users. FOSS maintains the software user's civil liberty rights via the \"Four Essential Freedoms\" of free software. Other benefits of using FOSS include decreased software costs, increased security against malware, stability, privacy, opportunities for educational usage, and giving users more control over their own hardware. Free and open-source operating systems such as Linux distributions and descendants of BSD are widely used today, powering millions of servers, desktops, smartphones, and other devices. Free-software licenses and open-source licenses are used by many software packages today. The free software movement and the open-source software movement are online social movements behind widespread production, adoption and promotion of FOSS, with the former preferring to use the terms FLOSS, free or libre.

      "content": "KDE Plasma KDE Plasma 5 is the fifth generation of the KDE Plasma graphical workspaces environment, created by KDE primarily for Linux systems. KDE Plasma 5 is the successor of KDE Plasma 4 and was first released on 15 July 2014. It was succeeded by KDE Plasma 6 on 28 February 2024. Plasma 5 includes a new default theme, \"Breeze\", and increased convergence across different devices. The graphical interface was fully migrated to QML, which uses OpenGL for hardware acceleration, providing better performance and reduced power consumption. Plasma Mobile is a Plasma 5 variant for Linux-based smartphones. Software architecture KDE Plasma 5 is built using Qt 5 and KDE Frameworks 5. It improves support for HiDPI displays and ships a convergable graphical shell, which can adjust itself according to the device in use. 5.0 also includes a new default theme, dubbed Breeze. Qt 5's QtQuick 2 uses a hardware-accelerated OpenGL(ES) scene graph (canvas) to compose and render graphics on the screen, which allows for the offloading of computationally expensive graphics rendering tasks onto the GPU, freeing up resources on the system's main CPU. Windowing systems KDE Plasma 5 uses the X Window System and Wayland. Support for Wayland was prepared in the compositor and planned for a later release. It was made initially available in the 5.4 release. Stable support for a basic Wayland session was provided in the 5.5 release (December 2015). Support for NVIDIA proprietary driver for Plasma on Wayland was added in the 5.16 release (June 2019). Development Since the split of the KDE Software Compilation into KDE Plasma, KDE Frameworks and KDE Applications, each subproject can develop at its own pace. KDE Plasma 5 is on its own release schedule, with feature releases every four months, and bugfix releases in the intervening months. Workspaces The latest Plasma 5 features the following workspaces: Plasma Desktop for any mouse or keyboard driven computing devices like desktops or laptops Plasma Mobile for smartphones Plasma Bigscreen for TVs and set-top boxes incl. voice interaction Plasma Nano, a minimal shell for embedded and touch-enabled devices, like IoT or automotive Desktop features KRunner, a search feature with many available plugins. In addition to launching apps, it can find files and folders, open websites, convert from one currency or unit to another, calculate simple mathematical expressions, and perform numerous other useful tasks. Flexible desktop and panel layouts composed of individual Widgets (also known as \"Plasmoids\") which can be individually configured, moved around, replaced with alternatives, or deleted. Each screen's layout can be individually configured. New widgets created by others can be downloaded within Plasma. Powerful clipboard with a memory of previously-copied pieces of text that can be called up at will. Systemwide notification system supporting quick reply and drag-and-drop straight from notifications, history view, and a Do Not Disturb mode. Central location to control playback of media in open apps, the phone (with KDE Connect installed), or the web browser (with Plasma Browser Integration installed) Activities, which allow users to separate methods of using the system into distinct workspaces. Each activity can have its own set of favorite and recently used applications, wallpapers, \"virtual desktops\", panels, window styles, and layout configurations. It also couples with ksmserver (X Session Manager implementation) which keeps track of apps that can be run or shutdown along with given activity via subSessions functionality that keep track of state of applications (not all applications support this feature as they do not implement XSMP protocol). Encrypted vaults for storing sensitive data. Night Color, which can automatically warm the screen colors at night, or user-specified times, or manually. Styling for icons, cursors, application colors, user interface elements, splash screens and more can be changed, with new styles created by others being downloadable from within the System Settings application. Global Themes allow the entire look and feel of the system to be changed in one click. Session Management allows apps which were running when the system shut down to be automatically restarted in the same state they were in before. History The first Technology Preview of Plasma 5 (at that time called Plasma 2) was released on 13 December 2013. On 15 July 2014, the first release version – Plasma 5.0 – was released. In spring 2015, Plasma 5 replaced Plasma 4 in many popular distributions, such as Fedora 22, Kubuntu 15.04, and openSUSE Tumbleweed. Releases See also: KDE Software Compilation § Release cycle Feature releases are released every four months (up to 5.8 every three months) and bugfix releases in the intervening months. Following version 5.8 LTS KDE plans to support each new LTS version for 18 months with bug fixes, while new regular releases will see feature improvements.

      "content": "KDE Plasma KDE Plasma 5 is the fifth generation of the KDE Plasma graphical workspaces environment, created by KDE primarily for Linux systems. KDE Plasma 5 is the successor of KDE Plasma 4 and was first released on 15 July 2014. It was succeeded by KDE Plasma 6 on 28 February 2024. Plasma 5 includes a new default theme, \"Breeze\", and increased convergence across different devices. The graphical interface was fully migrated to QML, which uses OpenGL for hardware acceleration, providing better performance and reduced power consumption. Plasma Mobile is a Plasma 5 variant for Linux-based smartphones. Software architecture KDE Plasma 5 is built using Qt 5 and KDE Frameworks 5. It improves support for HiDPI displays and ships a convergable graphical shell, which can adjust itself according to the device in use. 5.0 also includes a new default theme, dubbed Breeze. Qt 5's QtQuick 2 uses a hardware-accelerated OpenGL(ES) scene graph (canvas) to compose and render graphics on the screen, which allows for the offloading of computationally expensive graphics rendering tasks onto the GPU, freeing up resources on the system's main CPU. Windowing systems KDE Plasma 5 uses the X Window System and Wayland. Support for Wayland was prepared in the compositor and planned for a later release. It was made initially available in the 5.4 release. Stable support for a basic Wayland session was provided in the 5.5 release (December 2015). Support for NVIDIA proprietary driver for Plasma on Wayland was added in the 5.16 release (June 2019). Development Since the split of the KDE Software Compilation into KDE Plasma, KDE Frameworks and KDE Applications, each subproject can develop at its own pace. KDE Plasma 5 is on its own release schedule, with feature releases every four months, and bugfix releases in the intervening months. Workspaces The latest Plasma 5 features the following workspaces: Plasma Desktop for any mouse or keyboard driven computing devices like desktops or laptops Plasma Mobile for smartphones Plasma Bigscreen for TVs and set-top boxes incl. voice interaction Plasma Nano, a minimal shell for embedded and touch-enabled devices, like IoT or automotive Desktop features KRunner, a search feature with many available plugins. In addition to launching apps, it can find files and folders, open websites, convert from one currency or unit to another, calculate simple mathematical expressions, and perform numerous other useful tasks. Flexible desktop and panel layouts composed of individual Widgets (also known as \"Plasmoids\") which can be individually configured, moved around, replaced with alternatives, or deleted. Each screen's layout can be individually configured. New widgets created by others can be downloaded within Plasma. Powerful clipboard with a memory of previously-copied pieces of text that can be called up at will. Systemwide notification system supporting quick reply and drag-and-drop straight from notifications, history view, and a Do Not Disturb mode. Central location to control playback of media in open apps, the phone (with KDE Connect installed), or the web browser (with Plasma Browser Integration installed) Activities, which allow users to separate methods of using the system into distinct workspaces. Each activity can have its own set of favorite and recently used applications, wallpapers, \"virtual desktops\", panels, window styles, and layout configurations. It also couples with ksmserver (X Session Manager implementation) which keeps track of apps that can be run or shutdown along with given activity via subSessions functionality that keep track of state of applications (not all applications support this feature as they do not implement XSMP protocol). Encrypted vaults for storing sensitive data. Night Color, which can automatically warm the screen colors at night, or user-specified times, or manually. Styling for icons, cursors, application colors, user interface elements, splash screens and more can be changed, with new styles created by others being downloadable from within the System Settings application. Global Themes allow the entire look and feel of the system to be changed in one click. Session Management allows apps which were running when the system shut down to be automatically restarted in the same state they were in before. History The first Technology Preview of Plasma 5 (at that time called Plasma 2) was released on 13 December 2013. On 15 July 2014, the first release version – Plasma 5.0 – was released. In spring 2015, Plasma 5 replaced Plasma 4 in many popular distributions, such as Fedora 22, Kubuntu 15.04, and openSUSE Tumbleweed. Releases See also: KDE Software Compilation § Release cycle Feature releases are released every four months (up to 5.8 every three months) and bugfix releases in the intervening months. Following version 5.8 LTS KDE plans to support each new LTS version for 18 months with bug fixes, while new regular releases will see feature improvements.

      "content": "Linux Gaming Want to try linux, but worried about your games? Here's a guide to help you get started with gaming on linux. AfthabEK ProtonDB The unavailability of gaming options on Linux has long been a significant deterrent for Windows users considering the switch. For years, this has remained a prevalent issue. A few months ago, even I considered committing blasphemy and reverting to Windows, as I was unable to play my favorite games. However, recent developments such as the introduction of the Steam Deck—Valve’s latest gaming console based on Linux—and the emergence of Proton, a gaming environment, alongside major improvements in Wine, have effectively addressed this long-standing concern. After testing Genshin Impact, a popular AAA title, on my PC, I can confidently attest that my gaming experience on Linux has been on par, if not superior to my previous Windows gaming experience. The Steam Deck - Our Savior The Steam Deck, designed by Valve, is a pivotal milestone in Linux gaming. Its integration with Linux-based SteamOS and optimized gaming capabilities has significantly contributed to showcasing the potential of gaming on this platform. With Valve’s backing and support, Linux gaming has gained substantial traction, prompting further developments and support from game developers. Proton, a compatibility layer developed by Valve, enables the use of Windows games on Linux. It’s based on Wine, a compatibility layer that allows Windows applications to run on Linux. Proton’s integration with Steam has made it incredibly easy to install and play Windows games on Linux. While Proton is still in its early stages, it has already proven to be a viable solution for gaming on Linux. Flatpak - A way out of dependency hell Previously, configuring exact system requirements, drivers, and dependency versions for Wine and Proton posed a significant challenge. However, the advent of Flatpaks has simplified this process considerably. Flatpaks offer a solution by enabling the use of official app versions directly from developers, utilizing the intended dependencies on any Linux distribution. Setting up Flatpak across various distributions like Debian, Arch, Fedora, Ubuntu, and Manjaro has become relatively straightforward, ensuring a consistent experience across different Linux platforms. The alternative to Flatpak is Snap, which is a similar package manager. However, Snap is not as widely supported as Flatpak, and it’s not officially supported on Debian-based distributions. As a result, I recommend using Flatpak for the best experience. ProtonDB - A database for compatibility Due to the advent of steam deck, a lot of games are now being ported to Linux. You can check for the games directly supported on the GNU/Linux platform by searching on ProtonDB. ProtonDB is a community-driven database that provides information on the compatibility of Windows games with Linux. It also provides a rating for each game based on the user’s experience. This information is incredibly useful for determining whether a game is compatible with Linux and the potential performance issues that may arise. Lutris While it’s plausible to manually install all necessary software dependencies, using a gaming platform like Lutris significantly streamlines the process and minimizes hassle. To avoid potential dependency issues, I recommend installing Lutris via Flatpak. After installing Lutris, accessing and installing games becomes very straightforward. Simply navigate to lutris.net, search for your desired game, choose an install script, and follow the provided instructions for installation. I’ll be using Genshin Impact as an example. Genshin Impact is a popular free-to-play action role-playing game developed by Hoyoverse. I know some of you might judge me for playing this game, but we can debate on that later. It’s available on Windows, PlayStation, Android, and iOS. While it’s not officially supported on Linux, it can be installed and played using Lutris as a flatpak. To install Genshin Impact, Search Genshin impact on lutris.net, and select the latest install script. Then, click on the install button to install the game. After the installation is complete, you can launch the game from the Lutris library. After playing Genshin Impact for a month without experiencing a single frame drop, I can confidently say that my gaming experience on Linux has been on par, if not superior to my previous Windows gaming experience. While I can’t pinpoint the exact reason, it seems that WINE’s emulation of Windows might actually outperform Windows itself! You can also use other applications like Heroic Games Launcher, which is a native Linux client for the Epic Games Store. It’s still in its early stages, but it’s a promising alternative to Lutris. If you’re a fan of retro games, you can also use RetroArch, which is a frontend for emulators, game engines, and media players. It’s available on Flatpak. I’ve also tried out playing witcher 3 on my setup, although not for that long, and I’m getting 60 FPS at ultra settings, without any frame drops. This is the same performance I was getting on Windows 11, so I’m pretty happy with that. Conclusion With the exception of games that use Kernel-level anti-cheat software(Valorant smh), it’s possible to run almost any game on Linux, without any notable performance issues. All in all, Linux gaming has undergone a remarkable transformation, thanks to advancements in compatibility layers, dedicated gaming platforms, and the active support of the community. With these recent advancements, GNU/Linux can now be seens as a viable and compelling choice for gamers seeking a reliable and efficient gaming experience.

This event transforms email discussions into real-life conversations, promoting meaningful dialogue on various campus issues. Held at the Amphi-theatre during late evening hours, Kaapikootam addresses topics relevant to the student community, often sparked by extensive email threads. As the primary voice that unites students, this gathering fosters a sense of community and encourages thoughtful exchanges across a wide range of issues. The essence of Kaapikootam lies in its informal yet impactful nature. Over cups of coffee, participants engage in discussions that range from academic concerns to social issues, from campus facilities to cultural activities. By bringing these conversations out of the digital realm and into face-to-face interactions, Kaapikootam helps in building a more connected and cohesive student body. One of the unique aspects of Kaapikootam is its ability to bridge gaps between different student groups. Whether it's first-year students or final-year seniors, everyone is welcome to share their views and experiences. This inclusivity ensures that diverse perspectives are heard and considered, enriching the overall dialogue.

Written from the perspective of crows, it always accompanies its posts with memes, creating a blend of humor and critical commentary on campus life. Despite its humorous approach, Crow Talks plays a serious role in addressing important issues on campus. When a Crow Talks post drops, it often sends ripples through the administration, causing significant reactions; there was even an instance where the LND secretary's college email was banned due to a Crow Talks post​. The impact of Crow Talks is profound. It was instrumental in the first banishment of curfew and played a significant role in subsequent protests. The blog covers a wide array of topics including curfews, student rights, campus drama, administrative decisions, and more. Its posts are not just about casual reporting; they reflect deep insights and resonate strongly with the student body. Crow Talks has established itself as one of the most critical voices on campus, challenging the status quo and advocating for the student community​ Visit Crow Talks.

The impact of Crow Talks is profound. It was instrumental in the first banishment of curfew and played a significant role in subsequent protests. The blog covers a wide array of topics including curfews, student rights, campus drama, administrative decisions, and more. Its posts are not just about casual reporting; they reflect deep insights and resonate strongly with the student body.

The fest attracts thousands of visitors to the campus annually and is one of the most popular cultural fests in India.[2] History Over two decades have passed since the inception of Ragam. The humble yet controversial beginnings of this festival are well-known due to the infamous Rajan case that rocked Kerala in the seventies. Rajan, a student of the then CREC was taken into police custody during the Emergency period and allegedly died in custody in 1976.[1] In 1977 the All Kerala Rajan memorial music competition was started to commemorate his life. However, the same got discontinued in a few years. Later in 1987 the fest resurfaced as Ragam, an inter-college cultural fest in remembrance of Rajan. In 2006, Ragam was started with a solemn message ready by Eachara Warrier, father of late Rajan.[3] The prestigious ever-rolling Ragam trophy of \"Nataraj\", the trophy awarded to the overall champions at the fest, is considered as one of the most coveted prizes by the colleges in South India. The 31st edition of the fest was conducted in March 2017.[4] Pro Shows The Ragam pro-shows have always been noted for the celebrities who have performed at NIT Calicut. The shows are staged in the institute Football Ground, with a capacity of over 8000 spectators. Presently the Ragam \"nites\" include three cultural nites - ‘the inaugural nite’, ‘the highlight pro-show’, ‘the popular nite’. For the highlight pro-show, NIT Calicut has previously hosted some of the biggest singers in the country including popular youth icon Sunidhi Chauhan, Sukhwinder Singh, Shaan, Krishnakumar Kunnath (KK),[5] Farhan Akhtar, Sonu Nigam and Ankit Tiwari.[6] Most recently for Ragam'18, spectators had the opportunity to watch Vishal–Shekhar perform live.[7] Benny Dayal, Naresh Iyer,[5] Ranjith, Suraj Jagan and many more have taken the stage for the ‘Popular nite’, where a group of two or more singers perform for the crowds. Notable bands that have visited the fest in the past are Parikrama, Silk Route, Whitenoiz[8] and Motherjane along with tribute bands like Higher-on-maiden, Breathe the Floyd and Jail break. In 2011, Ragam witnessed a breathtaking performance by the 'Jai Ho' team. In 2009 Ragam became the first stage in Kerala to host a foreign band, with Breathe the Floyd, a tribute band to Pink Floyd.

      "content": "Ragam Logo Ragam is South India’s largest Cultural fest hosted by National Institute of Technology, Calicut.[1] Ragam blends a series of fine arts, socio-cultural and literary events, along with a variety of workshops, exhibitions and informal events. The fest attracts thousands of visitors to the campus annually and is one of the most popular cultural fests in India.[2] History Over two decades have passed since the inception of Ragam. The humble yet controversial beginnings of this festival are well-known due to the infamous Rajan case that rocked Kerala in the seventies. Rajan, a student of the then CREC was taken into police custody during the Emergency period and allegedly died in custody in 1976.[1] In 1977 the All Kerala Rajan memorial music competition was started to commemorate his life. However, the same got discontinued in a few years. Later in 1987 the fest resurfaced as Ragam, an inter-college cultural fest in remembrance of Rajan. In 2006, Ragam was started with a solemn message ready by Eachara Warrier, father of late Rajan.[3] The prestigious ever-rolling Ragam trophy of \"Nataraj\", the trophy awarded to the overall champions at the fest, is considered as one of the most coveted prizes by the colleges in South India. The 31st edition of the fest was conducted in March 2017.[4] Pro Shows The Ragam pro-shows have always been noted for the celebrities who have performed at NIT Calicut. The shows are staged in the institute Football Ground, with a capacity of over 8000 spectators. Presently the Ragam \"nites\" include three cultural nites - ‘the inaugural nite’, ‘the highlight pro-show’, ‘the popular nite’. For the highlight pro-show, NIT Calicut has previously hosted some of the biggest singers in the country including popular youth icon Sunidhi Chauhan, Sukhwinder Singh, Shaan, Krishnakumar Kunnath (KK),[5] Farhan Akhtar, Sonu Nigam and Ankit Tiwari.[6] Most recently for Ragam'18, spectators had the opportunity to watch Vishal–Shekhar perform live.[7] Benny Dayal, Naresh Iyer,[5] Ranjith, Suraj Jagan and many more have taken the stage for the ‘Popular nite’, where a group of two or more singers perform for the crowds. Notable bands that have visited the fest in the past are Parikrama, Silk Route, Whitenoiz[8] and Motherjane along with tribute bands like Higher-on-maiden, Breathe the Floyd and Jail break. In 2011, Ragam witnessed a breathtaking performance by the 'Jai Ho' team. In 2009 Ragam became the first stage in Kerala to host a foreign band, with Breathe the Floyd, a tribute band to Pink Floyd. In 2015 Ragam truly went international, with Swiss folk metal band Eluveitie performing for the 'nite'.

      "content": "Ragam Logo Ragam is South India’s largest Cultural fest hosted by National Institute of Technology, Calicut.[1] Ragam blends a series of fine arts, socio-cultural and literary events, along with a variety of workshops, exhibitions and informal events. The fest attracts thousands of visitors to the campus annually and is one of the most popular cultural fests in India.[2] History Over two decades have passed since the inception of Ragam. The humble yet controversial beginnings of this festival are well-known due to the infamous Rajan case that rocked Kerala in the seventies. Rajan, a student of the then CREC was taken into police custody during the Emergency period and allegedly died in custody in 1976.[1] In 1977 the All Kerala Rajan memorial music competition was started to commemorate his life. However, the same got discontinued in a few years. Later in 1987 the fest resurfaced as Ragam, an inter-college cultural fest in remembrance of Rajan. In 2006, Ragam was started with a solemn message ready by Eachara Warrier, father of late Rajan.[3] The prestigious ever-rolling Ragam trophy of \"Nataraj\", the trophy awarded to the overall champions at the fest, is considered as one of the most coveted prizes by the colleges in South India. The 31st edition of the fest was conducted in March 2017.[4] Pro Shows The Ragam pro-shows have always been noted for the celebrities who have performed at NIT Calicut. The shows are staged in the institute Football Ground, with a capacity of over 8000 spectators. Presently the Ragam \"nites\" include three cultural nites - ‘the inaugural nite’, ‘the highlight pro-show’, ‘the popular nite’. For the highlight pro-show, NIT Calicut has previously hosted some of the biggest singers in the country including popular youth icon Sunidhi Chauhan, Sukhwinder Singh, Shaan, Krishnakumar Kunnath (KK),[5] Farhan Akhtar, Sonu Nigam and Ankit Tiwari.[6] Most recently for Ragam'18, spectators had the opportunity to watch Vishal–Shekhar perform live.[7] Benny Dayal, Naresh Iyer,[5] Ranjith, Suraj Jagan and many more have taken the stage for the ‘Popular nite’, where a group of two or more singers perform for the crowds. Notable bands that have visited the fest in the past are Parikrama, Silk Route, Whitenoiz[8] and Motherjane along with tribute bands like Higher-on-maiden, Breathe the Floyd and Jail break. In 2011, Ragam witnessed a breathtaking performance by the 'Jai Ho' team. In 2009 Ragam became the first stage in Kerala to host a foreign band, with Breathe the Floyd, a tribute band to Pink Floyd. In 2015 Ragam truly went international, with Swiss folk metal band Eluveitie performing for the 'nite'. Sunburn Campus featuring DJ Diego Miranda for the first time in India took Ragam to new heights.

Ragam is South India’s largest Cultural fest hosted by National Institute of Technology, Calicut.[1] Ragam blends a series of fine arts, socio-cultural and literary events, along with a variety of workshops, exhibitions and informal events. The fest attracts thousands of visitors to the campus annually and is one of the most popular cultural fests in India.[2] History Over two decades have passed since the inception of Ragam. The humble yet controversial beginnings of this festival are well-known due to the infamous Rajan case that rocked Kerala in the seventies. Rajan, a student of the then-CREC was taken into police custody during the Emergency period and allegedly died in custody in 1976.[1] In 1977 the All Kerala Rajan memorial music competition was started to commemorate his life. However, the same got discontinued in a few years. Later in 1987 the fest resurfaced as Ragam, an inter-college cultural fest in remembrance of Rajan. In 2006, Ragam was started with a solemn message ready by Eachara Warrier, father of late Rajan.[3] The prestigious ever-rolling Ragam trophy of \"Nataraj\", the trophy awarded to the overall champions at the fest, is considered as one of the most coveted prizes by the colleges in South India. The 31st edition of the fest was conducted in March 2017.[4] Pro Shows The Ragam pro-shows have always been noted for the celebrities who have performed at NIT Calicut. The shows are staged in the institute Football Ground, with a capacity of over 8000 spectators. Presently the Ragam \"nites\" include three cultural nites - ‘the inaugural nite’, ‘the highlight pro-show’, ‘the popular nite’. For the highlight pro-show, NIT Calicut has previously hosted some of the biggest singers in the country including popular youth icon Sunidhi Chauhan, Sukhwinder Singh, Shaan, Krishnakumar Kunnath (KK),[5] Farhan Akhtar, Sonu Nigam and Ankit Tiwari.[6] Most recently for Ragam'18, spectators had the opportunity to watch Vishal–Shekhar perform live.[7] Benny Dayal, Naresh Iyer,[5] Ranjith, Suraj Jagan and many more have taken the stage for the ‘Popular nite’, where a group of two or more singers perform for the crowds. Notable bands that have visited the fest in the past are Parikrama, Silk Route, Whitenoiz[8] and Motherjane along with tribute bands like Higher-on-maiden, Breathe the Floyd and Jail break. In 2011, Ragam witnessed a breathtaking performance by the 'Jai Ho' team. In 2009 Ragam became the first stage in Kerala to host a foreign band, with Breathe the Floyd, a tribute band to Pink Floyd. In 2015 Ragam truly went international, with Swiss folk metal band Eluveitie performing for the 'nite'.

With his distinguished poses and his loveable eyes, Spanky was the apple of everyone's eye. The most gentle, kind being you would find on campus, he found company within the solace of others where he quietly joined in on events, celebrations and hangouts. Widely regarded as the only NITC-ian to attend (almost) every event on campus without fail, Spanky was a welcome guest anywhere he went. Ours eyes shall well and our hearts will ache as we pass through the corridors of the Main Building or lounge at the amphitheatre he called his home. NITC will never be the same without you.

      "content": "Welcome to WIKI FOSS Cell NITC This is a wiki based website for the Free and Open Source Software Community at NITC. What is FOSS? Free software is a matter of the users' freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. More precisely, it refers to four kinds of freedom, for the users of the software: The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0). The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2). The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition for this. For more information, please visit http://gnu.org Vision Free and Open Source Software is much more than a superior technology. It is a philosophy which lays emphasis on the rights of a user to copy, study, modify and redistribute code. It is based on the belief that Knowledge is a common heritage of mankind, and thus software, a form of knowledge, has to be free and accessible to all. Our vision is a society where the sharing of Knowledge is the norm, rather than the exception. Action Plan Popularize the use and spread awareness, in the campus, about the advantages of using Free Software, through demonstrations, installation fests etc. Provide support to nearby schools for the IT@School programme. Encourage students to get involved in Free Software development- both community Free Software projects and events like the Google Summer of Code. Discuss how and why FOSS can be used effectively in the curriculum, probably replacing proprietary tools. Initiative to develop FOSS tools in areas where they are lacking. Probably these can be taken up by students as part of their project work. Join with the NITC chapters of IEEE, CSI etc. to conduct events like FOSSMeet@NITC.

This refers to the unlawful arrest, torture and death of P Rajan, a final year engineering student of NITC, then the Regional Engineering College. He was picked up from the college by the Kerala Police along with Joseph Chaaly, also a student of REC, as a part of an investigation of their involvement in the Kaayanna Police Station attack on the 1st of March 1976. This was also the peak of the Emergency Period in India, when all fundamental rights of Indian citizens were suspended. It also coincided with the highest point of the Naxal Movement in Kerala. Rajan was detained unlawfully in Kakkayam Police Camp, under the supervision of Jayaram Padikkal, the then Crime Branch DIG of Kerala. He was never released despite the police having no clear proof of him being involved in the attack. There are also theories that Rajan was arrested as a vengeance tactic for having sung the song \"Kanakasimhasanathil Kayari Irikkunavan Shumbano atho Shunakano\" (a Malayalam song from the movie Arakkallan Mukkaalkallan which translates to the one who sits in the golden throne- is he an idiot or a dog?) when a minister visited REC. Rajan case is not just a landmark case but also a reminder to the student body of NITC of the importance of questioning authority who we are often taught to obey mindlessly. It tells us the necessity of politics for a student and reminds us of our roots. Every year, NITC conducts the Cultural Fest RAGAM to remember Rajan who was also a very culturally active student of REC. His father, Professor T V Echaara Warrier fought a long and strenuous legal battle to bring the police officers and the politicians (including the then Minister of Home Affairs and later Kerala Chief Minister, K Karunakaran) behind his son's unlawful arrest to the court of law.

The Regional Engineering Colleges (RECs) were established by the central government to mimic the IITs at a regional level and act as benchmarks for the other colleges in that state. The admission used to be highly selective. Students topping the respective state's 12th board exam could be admitted at the REC of their state. Thus, 17 RECs were established from 1959 onwards in each of the major states. Each college was a joint and cooperative enterprise of the central government and the concerned state government. The government opened 9 RECs in 1960, 2 on average in each region, as follows: Region Regional Engineering Colleges (REC) Eastern Region Durgapur and Jamshedpur Western Region Nagpur, Surat, and Bhopal Southern Region Warangal and Surathkal Northern Region Srinagar and Allahabad Later on, 6 more were added by 1967. The early 15 institutes were Srinagar, Warangal, Calicut, Durgapur, Kurukshetra, Jamshedpur, Jaipur, Nagpur, Rourkela, Surathkal, Surat, Tiruchirappalli, Bhopal, Allahabad, and Silchar. It established 2 more, one in Hamirpur in 1986, and another in Jalandhar in 1987. The success of the technology-based industry led to high demand for technical and scientific education. Due to the enormous costs and infrastructure involved in creating globally respected Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), in 2002 Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) Minister Murli Manohar Joshi decided to upgrade RECs to \"National Institutes of Technology\" (NITs) instead of creating IITs. The central government controls NITs and provides all funding. In 2002, all RECs became NITs. Retrieved from ‘https://wiki.fosscell.org/index.php?title=REC&oldid=1803’",

This event transforms email discussions into real-life conversations, promoting meaningful dialogue on various campus issues. Held at the Amphi-theatre during late evening hours, Kaapikootam addresses topics relevant to the student community, often sparked by extensive email threads. As the primary voice that unites students, this gathering fosters a sense of community and encourages thoughtful exchanges across a wide range of issues. Kaapikootam initially began as a way to talk about the SAC election and the proposals of the participating candidates. It was just an informal discussion for friends to join. It later extended to become a place where people could gather to talk, considering the mental health benefits of having a place to connect with new people. It was eventually that kaapikootam gained its present format- that of not just an informal gathering to meet new people, but also one that makes students aware of the challenges and issues going on in campus. The essence of Kaapikootam lies in its informal yet impactful nature. Over cups of coffee, participants engage in discussions that range from academic concerns to social issues, from campus facilities to cultural activities. By bringing these conversations out of the digital realm and into face-to-face interactions, Kaapikootam helps in building a more connected and cohesive student body. One of the unique aspects of Kaapikootam is its ability to bridge gaps between different student groups. Whether it's first-year students or final-year seniors, everyone is welcome to share their views and experiences. This inclusivity ensures that diverse perspectives are heard and considered, enriching the overall dialogue.

Until the formation of Calicut University in 1963, the institute was affiliated with Kerala University. It was largely due to the efforts of Pattom Thanu Pillai, then Chief Minister of Kerala, that the institute came into being. Prof. S. Rajaraman, first principal of Government Engineering College, Thrissur was appointed as the special officer in 1961 to organise the activities of the college until M. V. Kesava Rao took charge as the first principal of the college. The classes were initially held at the Government Polytechnic at West Hill, before it moved to its present campus in 1963. The college started with an annual intake of 125 students for the undergraduate courses, on a campus of 120 hectares (1.2 km2; 300 acres). Expansion The undergraduate courses' intake increased to 250 in 1966, 150 for the first year, and 100 for the preparatory course. The annual intake was reduced from 250 to 200 from the year 1968–69 on account of the industrial recession. After Prof S. Unnikrishnan Pillai took charge as principal in 1983, the Training and Placement Department was started to organise campus recruitments for students. The college moved into the area of information technology in 1984 with the commissioning of multi-user PSI Omni system and HCL workhorse PCs. In 1987 the college celebrated 25 years of its existence, and postgraduate courses were started. The CEDTI was established on the campus the following year. In 1990 Shankar Dayal Sharma inaugurated the Architecture Department Block and construction of a computer centre was completed. In 1996, the institute website (the first in Kerala) was launched. The Indian Institute of Management Calicut functioned from the NIT campus in its first few years of existence before moving to its new campus in Kunnamangalam in 2003. The Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, accorded NIT status to REC Calicut in June 2002 granting it academic and administrative autonomy. It was a lead institute under the World Bank-funded Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP) which began in 2002. In 2003, students were first admitted to the flagship undergraduate B.Tech through the All India Engineering Entrance Exam. With the passing of the National Institutes of Technology Act in May 2007, NIT Calicut was declared an Institute of National Importance.[8] The National Institutes of Technology Act is the second legislation for technical education institutions after the Indian Institutes of Technology Act of 1961.

The college started with an annual intake of 125 students for the undergraduate courses, on a campus of 120 hectares (1.2 km2; 300 acres). Expansion The undergraduate courses' intake increased to 250 in 1966, 150 for the first year, and 100 for the preparatory course. The annual intake was reduced from 250 to 200 from the year 1968–69 on account of the industrial recession. After Prof S. Unnikrishnan Pillai took charge as principal in 1983, the Training and Placement Department was started to organise campus recruitments for students. The college moved into the area of information technology in 1984 with the commissioning of multi-user PSI Omni system and HCL workhorse PCs. In 1987 the college celebrated 25 years of its existence, and postgraduate courses were started. The CEDTI was established on the campus the following year. In 1990 Shankar Dayal Sharma inaugurated the Architecture Department Block and construction of a computer centre was completed. In 1996, the institute website (the first in Kerala) was launched. The Indian Institute of Management Calicut functioned from the NIT campus in its first few years of existence before moving to its new campus in Kunnamangalam in 2003. The Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, accorded NIT status to REC Calicut in June 2002 granting it academic and administrative autonomy. It was a lead institute under the World Bank-funded Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP) which began in 2002. In 2003, students were first admitted to the flagship undergraduate B.Tech through the All India Engineering Entrance Exam. With the passing of the National Institutes of Technology Act in May 2007, NIT Calicut was declared an Institute of National Importance.[8] The National Institutes of Technology Act is the second legislation for technical education institutions after the Indian Institutes of Technology Act of 1961. In 2007 NIT Calicut raised its annual intake for its undergraduate programme to 570.[9] The annual intake for the undergraduate programme was increased to 1049 by 2011.

If someone from the NITC family unfortunately passes away then their mourning ceremony is performed here. When the administration decided to impose a curfew on the April of 2024 then SAC kept a special session of general meeting here.

      "content": "It is but a sad reality that regional politics is prevalent in NITC. The most prominent communal division in NITC is based on state and sometimes even regions in that state. Students often volunteer to be part of these state/region based groups. These groups can be a safe haven away from home where they get advisement from seniors and a sense of belonging among their peers from similar background. Although, these groups can also become epicenters for ragging. It is a somewhat necessary evil that unknowingly freshers become a part of and often dissociate in later years. SAC Elections The legacy of state groups and district groups have a different purpose for those in power. During SAC elections, communal politics has it's biggest impact. Evidently, most voters prefer to elect someone that their seniors advised them to elect. With this mentality, votes become a commodity to come to power and the heads of these groups make deals on behalf of these vote banks. Two of the most important SAC positions are TAS and CAS since they are appointed to decide the core team for Tathva and Ragam. These positions of responsibilities for the fests are not only a star in their personal resume, but can also be a way to illegally pocket some spare change since Lakhs of rupees are funded for these fests.

Some prefer to come here on the morning, others celebrate their birthdays and sometimes the club events such as Open Book Reading or Kaapikootam. Being in the middle of the campus, it is near the SSL Lab, the Main Building ,the CCC and Micro canteen, providing a common space for the people of NITC. If someone from the NITC family unfortunately passes away then their mourning ceremony is performed here. When the administration decided to impose a curfew on the April of 2024 then SAC kept a special session of general meeting here. For me this area signifies a common area for the students where they can express their joy, sadness, anger and empathy amongst each other i.e. a place of solidarity.

      "content": "National Institute Of Technology ,Calicut National Institute of Technology Calicut (NIT Calicut or NITC), formerly Regional Engineering College Calicut, is a public technical university and an institute of national importance governed by the NIT Act passed by the Parliament of India. The campus is situated 22 kilometres (14 mi) north east of Kozhikode, on the Kozhikode–Mukkam Road. It was established in 1961 and was known as Calicut Regional Engineering College (CREC) until 2002. It is one of the National Institutes of Technology campuses established by the Government of India for imparting high standard technical education to students from all over the country. NIT Calicut hosts a supercomputer on its campus,[6] and has a dedicated nanotechnology department. History Intial Years: National Institute of Technology, Calicut was set up in 1961 as Regional Engineering College Calicut (CREC), the ninth of its kind and the first one to be established during the Third Five-Year Plan period. Until the formation of Calicut University in 1963, the institute was affiliated with Kerala University. It was largely due to the efforts of Pattom Thanu Pillai, then Chief Minister of Kerala, that the institute came into being. Prof. S. Rajaraman, first principal of Government Engineering College, Thrissur was appointed as the special officer in 1961 to organise the activities of the college until M. V. Kesava Rao took charge as the first principal of the college. The classes were initially held at the Government Polytechnic at West Hill, before it moved to its present campus in 1963. The college started with an annual intake of 125 students for the undergraduate courses, on a campus of 120 hectares (1.2 km2; 300 acres). Expansion The undergraduate courses' intake increased to 250 in 1966, 150 for the first year, and 100 for the preparatory course. The annual intake was reduced from 250 to 200 from the year 1968–69 on account of the industrial recession. After Prof S. Unnikrishnan Pillai took charge as principal in 1983, the Training and Placement Department was started to organise campus recruitments for students. The college moved into the area of information technology in 1984 with the commissioning of multi-user PSI Omni system and HCL workhorse PCs. In 1987 the college celebrated 25 years of its existence, and postgraduate courses were started. The CEDTI was established on the campus the following year. In 1990 Shankar Dayal Sharma inaugurated the Architecture Department Block and construction of a computer centre was completed. In 1996, the institute website (the first in Kerala) was launched. The Indian Institute of Management Calicut functioned from the NIT campus in its first few years of existence before moving to its new campus in Kunnamangalam in 2003. The Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, accorded NIT status to REC Calicut in June 2002 granting it academic and administrative autonomy. It was a lead institute under the World Bank-funded Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP) which began in 2002. In 2003, students were first admitted to the flagship undergraduate B.Tech through the All India Engineering Entrance Exam. With the passing of the National Institutes of Technology Act in May 2007, NIT Calicut was declared an Institute of National Importance.[8] The National Institutes of Technology Act is the second legislation for technical education institutions after the Indian Institutes of Technology Act of 1961. In 2007 NIT Calicut raised its annual intake for its undergraduate programme to 570.[9] The annual intake for the undergraduate programme was increased to 1049 by 2011. Campus Hostels A and B hostels accommodate 1st-year B.Tech students. II-year and III-year B.Tech students are accommodated in the New Mega Hostel. G Hostel has been reallocated as a ladies' hostel, and female students enrolled in Ph.D. are staying in G hostel. Final year B.Tech students are accommodated in D, E, F, and PG-I hostels. M.Tech. and MCA students reside in apartments.

      "content": "National Institute Of Technology ,Calicut National Institute of Technology Calicut (NIT Calicut or NITC), formerly Regional Engineering College Calicut, is a public technical university and an institute of national importance governed by the NIT Act passed by the Parliament of India. The campus is situated 22 kilometres (14 mi) north east of Kozhikode, on the Kozhikode–Mukkam Road. It was established in 1961 and was known as Calicut Regional Engineering College (CREC) until 2002. It is one of the National Institutes of Technology campuses established by the Government of India for imparting high standard technical education to students from all over the country. NIT Calicut hosts a supercomputer on its campus,[6] and has a dedicated nanotechnology department. History Intial Years: National Institute of Technology, Calicut was set up in 1961 as Regional Engineering College Calicut (CREC), the ninth of its kind and the first one to be established during the Third Five-Year Plan period. Until the formation of Calicut University in 1963, the institute was affiliated with Kerala University. It was largely due to the efforts of Pattom Thanu Pillai, then Chief Minister of Kerala, that the institute came into being. Prof. S. Rajaraman, first principal of Government Engineering College, Thrissur was appointed as the special officer in 1961 to organise the activities of the college until M. V. Kesava Rao took charge as the first principal of the college. The classes were initially held at the Government Polytechnic at West Hill, before it moved to its present campus in 1963. The college started with an annual intake of 125 students for the undergraduate courses, on a campus of 120 hectares (1.2 km2; 300 acres). Expansion The undergraduate courses' intake increased to 250 in 1966, 150 for the first year, and 100 for the preparatory course. The annual intake was reduced from 250 to 200 from the year 1968–69 on account of the industrial recession. After Prof S. Unnikrishnan Pillai took charge as principal in 1983, the Training and Placement Department was started to organise campus recruitments for students. The college moved into the area of information technology in 1984 with the commissioning of multi-user PSI Omni system and HCL workhorse PCs. In 1987 the college celebrated 25 years of its existence, and postgraduate courses were started. The CEDTI was established on the campus the following year. In 1990 Shankar Dayal Sharma inaugurated the Architecture Department Block and construction of a computer centre was completed. In 1996, the institute website (the first in Kerala) was launched. The Indian Institute of Management Calicut functioned from the NIT campus in its first few years of existence before moving to its new campus in Kunnamangalam in 2003. The Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, accorded NIT status to REC Calicut in June 2002 granting it academic and administrative autonomy. It was a lead institute under the World Bank-funded Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP) which began in 2002. In 2003, students were first admitted to the flagship undergraduate B.Tech through the All India Engineering Entrance Exam. With the passing of the National Institutes of Technology Act in May 2007, NIT Calicut was declared an Institute of National Importance.[8] The National Institutes of Technology Act is the second legislation for technical education institutions after the Indian Institutes of Technology Act of 1961. In 2007 NIT Calicut raised its annual intake for its undergraduate programme to 570.[9] The annual intake for the undergraduate programme was increased to 1049 by 2011. Campus Hostels A and B hostels accommodate 1st-year B.Tech students. II-year and III-year B.Tech students are accommodated in the New Mega Hostel. G Hostel has been reallocated as a ladies' hostel, and female students enrolled in Ph.D. are staying in G hostel. Final year B.Tech students are accommodated in D, E, F, and PG-I hostels. M.Tech. and MCA students reside in apartments. Men's Hostel A hostel B Hostel C hostel D hostel E hostel F hostel G Hostel PG I PG II IH Mega Hostel MBA Hostel Women's Hostel Mega Ladies Hostel(MLH) Ladies Hostel(LH) LH block-1 LH block-2 LH block-3 LH block-4 Mess Each hostel has its own mess, and students are allowed to join any hostel mess, except for A and B, which are exclusive for first-year students. The type of food served in the hostel messes is as follows: Cosmopolitan: A, B, C (Kerala - vegetarian), D, E, PG I, IH (Andhra mess) Non-vegetarian: F, G & PG-II (North & South mixed) Two cosmopolitan messes are available on the ladies hostel premises. Other facilities like Night Mess, indoor shuttle court, gymnasium, and an extension of the Co-operative Society store are available in the ladies hostel. Central Library NITC's Central Library, with more than 100,000 books, is one of the largest technical libraries in India. It subscribes to more than 200 print journals. The institute has a digital library, Nalanda (Network of Automated Library and Archives), which houses online resources. Users of the institute and networked institutions can access around 17,000 journals, proceedings, databases, electronic theses, dissertations and online courses at Nalanda. It is part of the Indest consortium, which networks the libraries at technical institutions in India. NIT Calicut's supercomputer, Purna (Parallel Universal Remote Numerical Analyser), is accessible from anywhere in the campus and is provided for the use of all students and faculty members. PURNA has a peak speed of 1.5 teraflops The Administration The collage administration is a group of faculties who make rules and policies for students as well as teachers and all non-teaching staffs of the collage.

      "content": "Introduction Kattangal is a town near NITC. It is a frequent visiting place for the students. It has emerged as a bustling town due to its proximity to the university campus.

Here are some best practices to help you set up your wiki page: Using Different Levels of Headers Organize your content using headers of various levels. This creates a clear hierarchy and makes it easier for readers to follow. Use == Heading == for main sections and === Subheading === for subsections. For deeper levels, you can use more equal signs. == Main Heading == === Subheading === ==== Sub-subheading ==== Utilize Lists Lists are great for breaking down information into manageable chunks. You can use bullet points or numbered lists to organize your points. bulleted lists * Item 1 * Item 2 * Item 3 Numbered Lists 1. First item 2. Second item 3. Third item This can be attained by adding # at the first line. Line Breaks Use the tag to insert a line break when you need to create space without starting a new paragraph. Line one Line two Using Bold And Italics Texts Highlight important information by using bold and italic texts. ''Italic text'' for emphasis '''Bold text''' for strong emphasis Code Blocks To use code blocks as seen in the above subsections ,simply add a space before the text you are going to write (in a new line) Retrieved from ‘https://wiki.fosscell.org/index.php?title=Best_practices&oldid=2184’",

      "content": "NIT Cailcut was previously known as REC Calicut. The Regional Engineering Colleges (RECs) were established by the central government to mimic the IITs at a regional level and act as benchmarks for the other colleges in that state. The admission used to be highly selective. Students topping the respective state's 12th board exam could be admitted at the REC of their state. Thus, 17 RECs were established from 1959 onwards in each of the major states. Each college was a joint and cooperative enterprise of the central government and the concerned state government. The government opened 9 RECs in 1960, 2 on average in each region, as follows: Region Regional Engineering Colleges (REC) Eastern Region Durgapur and Jamshedpur Western Region Nagpur, Surat, and Bhopal Southern Region Warangal and Surathkal Northern Region Srinagar and Allahabad Later on, 6 more were added by 1967. The early 15 institutes were Srinagar, Warangal, Calicut, Durgapur, Kurukshetra, Jamshedpur, Jaipur, Nagpur, Rourkela, Surathkal, Surat, Tiruchirappalli, Bhopal, Allahabad, and Silchar. It established 2 more, one in Hamirpur in 1986, and another in Jalandhar in 1987. The success of the technology-based industry led to high demand for technical and scientific education. Due to the enormous costs and infrastructure involved in creating globally respected Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), in 2002 Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) Minister Murli Manohar Joshi decided to upgrade RECs to \"National Institutes of Technology\" (NITs) instead of creating IITs. The central government controls NITs and provides all funding. In 2002, all RECs became NITs. Retrieved from ‘https://wiki.fosscell.org/index.php?title=REC&oldid=2215’",

LASER PRINTER ( 1 No.) A laser printer is a popular type of personal computer printer that uses a non-impact (keys don't strike the paper), photocopier technology. When a document is sent to the printer, a laser beam \"draws\" the document on a selenium-coated drum using electrical charges. After the drum is charged, it is rolled in toner, a dry powder type of ink. The toner adheres to the charged image on the drum. The toner is transferred onto a piece of paper and fused to the paper with heat and pressure. After the document is printed, the electrical charge is removed from the drum and the excess toner is collected. Most laser printers print only in monochrome. A color laser printer is up to 10 times more expensive than a monochrome laser printer. 8. OSCILLOSCOPE ( 10 Nos.)

      "content": "Solving mazes is a computational problem appearing in a wide range of situations - starting from puzzles, social networks and system verification applications. The fundamental abstraction of this problem is the graph reachability problem which asks if given a graph G and two special vertices s and t, is t reachable from s or not? The question of whether or not this problem can be solved using space that is logarithmic in the number of vertices, encapsulates the centre stage of space complexity theory. The problem captures the famous NL vs L problem in complexity theory. Designing unambiguously non-deterministic algorithms that use small space are important stepping stones in this direction. This talk aims to motivate and give an overview of the ideas on this frontier. It will present some of our recent contributions and current research efforts.

Event website File:Floss meet 05.jpg Blogs Dilip V (internal link) Atul Chitnis [...] I started with an introduction of FOSS, and ended with an overview of FOSS in India. Hopefully, I will have made things clear enough to people to get them excited and (more importantly) involved. Lots of questions after the talk, so I am hopeful that the talk was useful to the 100+ people in the audience. [...] Slides Swaroop CH [...] Soon, Pradeep and myself took over the stage and we started asking the students about what their previous programming experience and what they are interested in. Almost all students knew C++ and didn’t know Perl. So, yaay! They hadn’t been spoilt by Perl and we knew it would be exciting to introduce them to a clean language like Python to C++ students. [...] Other Blog entries from Swaroop Python workshop at NIT Calicut Talk at FLOSS Meet tomorrow Trek at Thusharagiri Pradeep Kishore Gowda [...] I’m back from Calicut after giving a talk on Python @ NIT Calicut’s Free/Libre Open Source software meet. Me and Swaroop talked about Python for nearly 3 hours. Going by the number of questions that were asked and the students approaching us to talk in the lunch break, I’m sure there are a new bunch of Pythonistas in Calicut :) This was my largest audience so far with nearly 150 people comprising of students and staff. [...] Shankar Balan [...] Back from the Floss meet at NIT, Calicut where I gave a presentation on BSD titled - The Devil's Side of OpenSource. At the start of the talk there were < 5 in the audience who were aware of BSD, the number should now be > 125 at least. :) [...] photos Pradeep's flickr galley Swaroop's flickr album FOSS Meet @ NITC 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Retrieved from ‘https://wiki.fosscell.org/index.php?title=FOSSMEET_2005&oldid=2320’",

      "content": "Guys and Gals, I like to write more about the Floss meet held @ NIT Calicut.. FLOSS MEET @ NITC We had a small inauguration function in Arya Bhatta Lecture Hall. I was sitting in the stage with Dr. S S Gokhale (the director of NIT Calicut), Dr. K P Mohandas, Dr. Abraham T Mathew Mr Sudhakar (Vice President of CSI) and Praveen ! .There were some 140-150 delegates in the AryaBhatta Hall .We had to Swap the sessions as Atul was coming Late .. So We had \"The Magical World of Python\" by Swaroop and Pradeep was in the Morning Session.. It was a very Interactive session .. I couldnt Attend most of the part of it as I had to go to get the Wi Fi Connection in Atul's Computer ..I hope I will be able to attend Swaoop's talk in GEC Thrissur for the Rennaisance 2005. Pradeep talked about his Company Zeomega infotech, in the end. Swaroop had brought some Yahoo ! T Shirts along with him .. He didnt simply wanted to distribute it , so He asked some questions related to the Free software world , and those who answered first will get a nice Yahoo ! T Shirt. I was lucky to answer the name of the founderer of the free software foundation Stallman ..Wow I Have a nice Yahoo T Shirt now with me .. Praveen also got one . Shanker Started the session after the lunch... Then Our LCD Started showing back the us .. We had to get a new LCD from the Library .... Thus the session started late by 30 minutes .. It was a interesting talk about the BSD , The Devil's Side of Open Source\" .. He told about the BSD Licence .. I now consider to learn that .. Then we had the Talk by Atul Chitnis about the FLOSS, and its effect in India. It was so intersting.. Most of the students rated his speech as A + . If you like to see a person who can think and speak at the same time , then there is only one person that is Chitnis. I went to meet our speakers in the Guest House in the night .. I enjoyed having food with them .. In between the food Shanu was explaing about the differnt kerala dishes to others.. After that I expressed my doubts about the IT Field and companies to Atul and Shanu.. They also wanted my to become a Geek ... i dont know if a Geek is made or born . Am I Already a Geek ? Dont Know ? I took Swaroop and Pradeep to show Our campus .. I showed them most of the parts of it , our Main CC, hostels , Library etc.. They were amazed by the size and greenary of our college.. Praveen showed Swaroop the Ubuntu Linux and he seemed to like it also .. I Like those guys ,, I felt so intimate to them also .... THUSHRAGIRI We Planned to go to Thusharagiri Waterfalls in the Sunday ., As usual I have to wake up Praveen.. We reached the guest house by 9 am .. and the Tata Sumo was also ready.. But our friends were still sleeping .. So we started the journey at 9 30 am .. They road to Thusharagiri is pretty Okay and its freee from the City traffic.. There are some shops in the down hill of Thusharagiri were yu can actually order for the food in advance.. We ordered for Chappathy and Meals. We started climbing .. There are actually 5 Waterfalls and you can cover only 3 in one day .. otherwise you need to stay there in the tent . The names of the waterfalls are funny, it is like Thenn Mala ( Honey Hill )... It is really a tiresome journey .. But adventurous.. Praveen had already came there for the NSS Camp .. So he was sure about the Paths through the forest.. You can find and feel the Real \" Gods Own Country There \"Swaroop was trying to take \" Every Bit of Thusharagiri in his Digi Cam \" .. I dont know if he has succeeded in that ... Need to check his photo Album . We were very hungry by the time we reached back to the station... Praveen and Me Had the rice meals.. which tasted delicious... Swaroop and Pradeep had Chappathy.. ( Dont know how it was ! ). We were all sleeping in the Car in the return journey. All were deadly tired... But Swaroop still showed his enthu to climb the 4th Waterfall too... Amazing Man ... Ya me and praveen accompanied to the Railway station in the aftenoon.. I showed them the Regal Bakery.. All of them except Shanu bought a lots of sweets and Bannana Chips... They bought the parcel food for the Dinner .. The Train came in time.. we had to run to the Front side , as the AC Coach was a bit far away. We thanked all for coming here to our college .... Probable we will meet them all in the next Linux Bangalore ( oops!.. sorry LB's Name is gonna change right so in the next OSS meet organised by Atul. ) . Every thing is over ..Still the fire is burning in us ... It will be there for a long time.. Hope that most of the student attended the FLOSS MEET , will be move toward the Patent Free world of Softwares. I dont know how to express my thanks to Swaroop, Pradeep, Shanu, Atul , Praveen, Aswin, Jove, Bibin, Pullat and other who co operated with the event. Thank you all !

Goals For wiki for the coming 6 months extending wiki usage through B23: Direct student doubts regarding course work,clubs ,professors and nitc as a whole to wiki instead of answering each and every question .this can be used as an effective strategy to introduce students to wiki. for this wiki links and brief discussions of the same will be sent to B24 groups Create a \"intro to nitc/college\" page : push it through members of the community and SGC maybe . B23's were sent a seperate file but instead we hope we can push that through wiki this time. Creating a basic map of NITC for B24's to satisfy their curiosity . simplified tree type map is also sufficent . but as per the suggestion of @AkhilT we think that using an extension that links open street maps and wiki NITC is a better solution. Add academic calenders to wiki for easy access can help attract more traffic to the site as it is easier than finding the pdf of the same and downloading it. simplification of wiki homepage: the ` meeting reached consensus that the current wiki homepage is cluttered and is not user friendly especially in the case of first time users . Ideas for the reorganisation of the homepage is under discussion . the revised homepage should definitely provide easy access to the above mentioned NITC Maps project and the academic callender project. Pubish the NITC wiki app Add more photos to wiki update various course related pages : encourage B24 students to do the same. Create a LinkedIn page for wiki and attempt to make wiki a more legitmate platform that documents the events happening within NITC for the future.

I engaged the crowd for a few minutes on the kind of music they like, and what they do with that music. Spoke about Anu Malik, what they thought about his music. What they thought were the legalities of some of his tracks as well as the creativity. Most of them said they liked the music, but didn't think that it was legal.[...] FOSS@NITC FOSS@NITC day 2 Gopal V [...]The organization of FOSS @ NITC surprised me, compared to what I'd seen at other similar conferences. Compared to what went on at GNUnify, these guys are a lot more decentralized in organization and had quite a feel of a student run tech fest. I hardly saw any faculty running around, except for Amarjeet. The faculty was more of facilitiating the event rather than running the event and their pulls on the event was not quite obvious, if any. Quite heartening indeed from my point of view.[...] FOSS @ NITC 2006 Fun in Calicut Sarath Lakshman [...]I really enjoyed the FOSS event. I missed some of the talks due to schedule of my talk. My workshop was conducted at NITC computer Lab. Actually NITC guyz expected for a hands on workshop..but due to it feel boring to audience I made it into a demo based talk with a practical session. No hands on. So many students at NITC asked me some doubts and I became cheerful in answering and clearing their doubts.

Safe CGPA - Please please maintain at least the safe CGPA ( 8+ for non-cse, 7.5+ for cse ) throughout your college life. No matter which profession you later switch to, this will always be judged. The best times to get a high CGPA is, you guessed it right, first year... Another point to remember your 2nd and 3rd yrs have the most important topics of your subject, so try not to doze off in class. 2. Enjoy college life to fullest - Yess, sounds cliche but so very true. Try to explore things and get out of your comfort zone. It's not all about marks and labs, you NEED to have a life out of it. Best way to do this? Socialise :) Oh also, don't miss out Tathva and Ragam. With the right gang it will be your best night in college. And seriously do take pictures of you in class and everyday life, you will be missing these when you look back. 3. Placement related tips - 1. Do internships every sem break - Try to do some internship at a company ( can be startups too) or projects under professors of IITs,NITs ( our profs do some cool research work too!) or a training programme in PSUs like BSNL,NTPC, etc. IITs have paid internship programmes during summer whose submission deadlines are pretty early so keep an eye out for that. If you missed that, you can always personally mail profs who work on your interested area. (Mind you, some unlucky cases it takes 100 emails to get a position) Orrrrr.... hit up the relatives/family friends you have in different companies/institutes and ask them about this. ( Internships for which you have to pay for isn't preferred ) 2. Do projects - Try online courses and projects. These are always a boost to your resume. When it comes to certain cases like Machine learning, it's better to start with a project and refer theory side by side.(You HAVE to do the project on your own, not just to add a certification in your resume) 3. Start with a rough resume - Prepare a rough resume in your first year and keep updating it through the years. This will help you immensely when it comes to placement processes. 4. Coding, a necessity - Whether you are in core branch or CSE in B.tech - you need to know basic coding ie C++. Even core companies look for this so be safe and learn basic DSA and C++. If this interests you further, go on ahead with web dev or cloud computing or machine learning & AI or learning languages like Python/Java. You can also take up projects on your core subject with extensions to ML. Beginner friendly sites - Geekforgeeks, Hackerrank, Codechef, really any site is fine as long as you work. If you get stuck at any point there's always Google. 5. Basic knowledge of softwares - Get a basic knowledge of essential softwares like excel, photoshop, video editing etc. These skills will help you out in the long run. 6. Aptitude tests - Most of the companies have an aptitude section so it is wise to be reasonably good at them. There are many sites that provide you free aptitude tests, one of the popular ones being - https://www.indiabix.com/ 7. Have a co-curriculars as well - Joining a club can really help you out in this aspect. Having some hobbies (other than eating and sleeping ofc) that you like will really help you out in HR round. Other than that work on your general awareness and interview skills.The usual advice, try reading newspaper daily ( Bonus tip - the newspaper reading room in library has the best AC in campus) 8. Placement experiences - Go through placement experiences of your seniors ( usually put up by departmental associations ) to get a rough idea of the profile of the company. Prepare for the commonly asked interview questions and most importantly projects on your resume when you get shortlisted. 9. Linkedin profile - Start a linkedin profile and work on it, this help you a lot in your professional career later on. Lastly on a fun note, get blessed by our rajpath crows to get a placement.It's true, some people vouch for it ;) 4. Join a club or association or committee or sports : Technical clubs like RIG,Unwired,Aerounwired,FOSSCELL,AI club,IEEE are definetely gives a shine to your resume and you will learn quite a lot if you are an active part of these.Departmental associations give you academic and managerial experience.Non-technical clubs like Club Mathematica, ISTE, IPF, LnD,DnD,ICA,MC,Enquire, Adventure, NSS, AV ,HVG ,IEDC, Forestry club,Magazine Committee definitely gives you an edge in terms of communicative skills and event coordination. And during Tathva and Ragam there are various cultural teams and organizing committees, try to join and have some fun. Lastly but definitely not the least, there's our institutional body SGC. Being an active part of any of these will be time consuming so do balance out your attendance, assignment deadlines and grades. While it's a good experience if you get into a club, you will be absolutely fine otherwise with a lot of time to focus on yourself. 5. Academic related tips: Keep an alarm for almost everything – From waking up at 8 to a very strict TnP (Training and placement cell) deadlines, it is better have an alarm than go for attendance condonation but try not to make your room-mate want to murder you. On that note, don't skip breakfast/lunch for your crazy daily schedule, our lovely canteens (Main,mini,micro,nano) got your back. Practice a fast walking speed to ace that \"Woke up at 7:55, had breakfast and now I'm in class\" level. Short notes – If you have plans to work in your subject itself or confused about what to do in life, start by making short notes of your subjects. These not only help your college exams, but other career examinations and interviews in future. Trying to follow a study schedule and have 8+ hrs sleep will be almost every NITCian's dream. Places with AC like CCC,Study room can help you beat the heat at least while trying to complete portions. Enjoy some evening time in campus with your friends. Don't worry almost NOBODY gets time to study daily after all the classes and labs. The evening time need to be utilised to relax a little. It's a GREAT thing if you can set aside sometime everyday to revise what was taught in class. Last min prep advice – a) Get short notes from bhujjis b) Go through previous papers c) Finish easier portions d) Rather than reading the problems, try solving them by hand e) Hoard lots of food for exam nights f) Your friends are the best teachers on the eve of exam g) God bless Youtube videos & Google Are you the quiet kind that doesn't get noticed much and trying to change that? Solution is simple - Bring a water bottle to class. Your valuble service will be appreciated throughout the class and you are the saviour to all sleepy heads trying to stay awake. Who knew becoming an aquarius in class would get you friends. 6. Career choices: It's normal to feel confused about what to do after college, but most of you will figure out what you want ( or what you don't want ) by 3rd year. If you are still confused, try different things just go ahead with the best opportunity you get and hope it's for the best. Some of the popular choices are given below. These are some of the important points for a beginner, go on to further research these up later on. MBA - Requires preparation for CAT, try some coaching centre in 3rd yr or do self preparation. Most popular ones are TIME, Career Launcher. Club Mathematica usually partners with TIME, to conduct a scholarship test, which will offer you discount on the TIME coaching. TIME kozhikode provides coaching center is available right near our college. Next stage will be WAT or interview, in which they ask your subjects and general awareness so beware! Taken in 4th yr, 1 yr validity. GATE/ESE - These help you to get a job in PSUs or join M.Tech, so be really good at your core subjects, so preparing short notes from 1st yr helps you a lot. Can be taken in 3rd and 4th yr. 3 yrs validity. Usually students opt for self preparations with question papers bought online. Online coaching available too. Popular sites - ACE, MadeEasy. MS -If you are looking out on MS or research oriented career, start off by working under some professor and try to publish a conference paper. These will definitely aid your application process. Recommendation letters are all the more important for you, so choose your professor wisely. You also need a good GRE score (if you are aiming US universities) or TOEFL ( countries like Germany, Australia) so start preparing early for that. Apply for international academic exchange programs like DAAD early on to get those top notch recommendations. Coaching services (if required) like Byjus help you with the complete process. 7. Some great food places to try - When you go back to offline sem, uphold our legacy and try out Kattangal Maggi & chaat places, Wez Cafe, Waffee house, Decosta, Cafe plus, Burger lounge, Monarch , Lassi house, Bake house, Broast, Steam House. And on behalf of us say Hi to Cops chetta, Amul aunty, milma uncle, Micro uncle and uncle in MC. If you are looking for places to eat in Kozhikode, there are so many - Sixth avenue, Downtown, Paragon , Berry bomb... the list goes on. Try Hi-Lite, focus malls too.(Most of these are expensive compared to mini, so do the math) Places to visit in Kozhikode - Not much honestly, all food places and lot of beaches look amazing when you go with friends. Do visit some of these beautiful beaches,it's worth the bus ride. 8. Online part-time work - Try to replenish your pocket money with easy part-time opportunities for creative writing,social media marketing etc available on Internshala. The skillset is useful and the money will definetely keep you financially stable. 9. Make good use of college resources - Our college spends a lot for both online and offline resources. We get an institutional access for many paid softwares and student packs. Make sure try out most of them. We'll try to put out a list of access provided by campus. 10. Common rookie mistakes to avoid - Losing your college ID card/grade card/library book, Messing with the hostel wardens, Forgetting to give the mess card asap, Forgetting to put phone on silent in class, Forgetting your umbrella, Leaving your food unattended in mini (crows duh). While there are so many more things we wish we could be in campus with you guys and tell, we are sure you will figure it out yourselves. Remember we seniors got your back if you ever need us and we'll be happy to help you out. So keep calm and enjoy your college days! :')) DISCLAIMER:this piece of content was not made by me .

      "content": "Hey, fellow NITCians and anyone browsing through cyberspace Below, I'll be answering major WH questions, including what, why, and how Wiki exists, as well as much more. What is Wiki NITC? You might have used Wikipedia at some point in your life. Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia that contains a vast number of articles about everything under and above the sun. The community that develops and maintains Wikipedia and its related projects is called the Wikimedia Foundation. The software used to power Wikipedia is called MediaWiki. It is a highly customizable and extensible web application built with PHP. It comes as an easily self-hostable setup and uses MySQL/MariaDB to store all the data in a database. Think of MediaWiki as a genie who sits at a desk, and the database as a book they have with them. You can share your knowledge with the genie, and they'll write it down and edit existing entries, and anyone else searching for information will be able to receive it through the genie. NITC Wiki is our own genie that we have set up so that users like you can find anything and everything related to NITC here, and if something is missing, you can add it to the register. Who is behind Wiki NITC? We are also just students like you who came before you and had our stories take shape on the campus we all call our second home. The community is volunteer-based, and we encourage more of you to be active participants in the effort to keep Wiki NITC a safe and nurturing space. When did Wiki NITC start? The software was deployed in January 2024, and we began going public within a few weeks. We have held wiki sprints and wiki marathons to engage the community and encourage detailed contributions about the campus. We hope that this platform will continue for many years to come and remain an active resource with information useful to those who seek it. Where is Wiki NITC Hosted? In terms of the technical side of things, the MediaWiki service is currently running in an Oracle VM on a free tier. The setup is mostly containerized, and we are in the process of fully making it reproducible so that you can deploy it anywhere with minimal steps. Feel free to check out self-hostable tools to know more about setting up your own software in the cloud, and we might need your help going forward to keep the project online. Why does Wiki NITC exist? Knowingly or unknowingly, I have already hinted at the answer to this question in previous responses. The project started as an effort to archive and preserve the legacy of FOSSCell and its flagship event, FOSSMeet. FOSSMeet is one of India’s longest-running FOSS-themed community gatherings. It began in 2005, and you can find more details about it here. The story of FOSSMeet is still largely preserved thanks to the blogs and articles of people who attended the event. We realized that the same could be said about the rich history of NITC and the REC that existed before NITC. The rich legacy of our campus and the people who have been part of it should not be forgotten, and the purpose of Wiki NITC is to ensure that we hold on to the memories of those who came before us. How can I help? So the platform was completely open until a while ago. Anyone was allowed to write or edit any articles without any need for signups or logins. But to make the community a healthier and safer space for everyone, we have restricted the account generation to NITC email. We will be implementing the NITC lockdown ASAP, and you'll be able to write and edit articles about the things you love. Browse through, read, and edit—that's the best way you could support us. If you want to actively help with the platform in other ways, do reach out to us. And with that, I hope you have a general idea about the platform. As of now, the platform is more leaning towards a \"search and you shall find\" model. We are working hard to bring more and more interesting articles to you easily.

      "content": "About the Authors This article was written collaboratively by Aadil Krishna and Aadil Krishna Aadil0h Aadil0h Other recent contributors Make this page better by editing it. by Aadil Krishna and Aadil Krishna created 13:21, 11 August 2024 , last edited 16:01, 25 August 2024 1Vote 1Vote Brace yourselves, a long message is coming * Academic Success Safe CGPA: Please, please maintain at least a safe CGPA ( 8+ for non-CSE, 7.5+ for CSE ) throughout your college life. No matter which profession you later switch to, this will always be judged. The best time to get a high CGPA is, you guessed it right, your first year... Another point to remember your 2nd and 3rd years have the most important topics of your subject, so try not to doze off in class. Academic tips: Keep an alarm for almost everything – From waking up at 8 to a very strict TnP (Training and placement cell) deadline, it is better to have an alarm than go for attendance condonation but try not to make your roommate want to murder you. On that note, don't skip breakfast/lunch for your crazy daily schedule, our lovely canteens (Main, mini, micro, nano) have your back. Practice a fast walking speed to ace that \"Woke up at 7:55, had breakfast and now I'm in class\" level. Short notes – If you have plans to work on your subject itself or are confused about what to do in life, start by making short notes on your subjects. These not only help your college exams but also other career examinations and interviews in future.Trying to follow a study schedule and have 8+ hours of sleep will be almost every NITCian's dream. Places with AC like CCC, and Study Room can help you beat the heat at least while trying to complete portions. Enjoy some evening time on campus with your friends - Don't worry almost NOBODY gets time to study daily after all the classes and labs. The evening time needs to be utilised to relax a little. It's a GREAT thing if you can set aside some time every day to revise what was taught in class. Last min prep advice – a) Get short notes from Bhujjis(smart kids) b) Go through previous papers c) Finish easier portions d) Rather than reading the problems, try solving them by hand e) Hoard lots of food for exam nights f) Your friends are the best teachers on the eve of the exam g) God bless YouTube videos & Google Are you the quiet kind that doesn't get noticed much and trying to change that? The solution is simple - Bring a water bottle to class. Your valuable service will be appreciated throughout the class and you are the saviour to all sleepy heads trying to stay awake. Who knew becoming an Aquarius in class would get you friends? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Placements (Focus on coding, projects, internships) Do internships every sem break - Try to intern at a company ( or startup ) or projects under professors of IITs, NITs ( our profs do some cool research work too! ) or a training programme in PSUs like BSNL, NTPC, etc. IITs have paid internship programmes during summer whose submission deadlines are pretty early so keep an eye out for that. If you missed that, you can always personally mail profs who work on your interested area. (Mind you, in some unlucky cases it takes 100 emails to get a position) Orrrrr.... hit up the relatives/family friends you have in different companies/institutes and ask them about this. ( Internships for which you have to pay aren't preferred ) Do projects - Try online courses and projects. These are always a boost to your resume. When it comes to certain cases like Machine learning, it's better to start with a project and refer to theory side by side. (You HAVE to do the project on your own, not just to add a certification to your resume) Coding is a necessity - Whether you are in a core branch or CSE for B.tech, you need to know basic coding i.e. C++. Even core companies look for this so be safe and learn basic DSA and C++. If this interests you further, go on ahead with web dev or cloud computing, machine learning & AI or learning languages like Python/Java. You can also take up projects on your core subject with extensions to ML. (Beginner-friendly sites: Geekforgeeks, Hackerrank, Codechef, really any site is fine as long as you work. If you get stuck at any point there's always Google.) Basic knowledge of software - Get a basic knowledge of essential software like Excel, Photoshop, video editing etc. These skills will help you out in the long run. Have a co-curricular - Joining a club can really help you out in this aspect. Having some hobbies (other than eating and sleeping ofc) that you like will help you out in the HR round. Other than that work on your general awareness and interview skills. The usual advice, try reading the newspaper daily ( Bonus tip - the newspaper reading room in the library has the best AC on campus) Career Development Tips(Internships, projects, aptitude tests): Start with a rough resume - Prepare a rough resume in your first year and keep updating it throughout the years. This will help you immensely when it comes to placement processes. Aptitude tests - Most companies have an aptitude section so it is wise to be reasonably good at them. Many sites provide you with free aptitude tests, one of the popular ones being - https://www.indiabix.com/ Placement experiences - Go through the placement experiences of your seniors ( usually put up by departmental associations ) to get a rough idea of company profiles. Prepare for the commonly asked interview questions and most importantly projects on your resume when you get shortlisted. Lastly, on a fun note, get blessed by our Rajpath crows to get a placement. It's true, some people vouch for it ;) Career choices (MBA, GATE/ESE, MS): It's normal to feel confused about what to do after college, but most of you will figure out what you want ( or what you don't want ) by 3rd year. If you are still confused, try different things just go ahead with the best opportunity you get and hope it's for the best. Some of the popular choices are given below. These are some of the important points for a beginner, go on to further research these later on. MBA - Requires preparation for CAT, try some coaching centre in 3rd yr or do self-preparation. The most popular ones are TIME and Career Launcher. Club Mathematica usually partners with TIME, to conduct a scholarship test, which will offer you a discount on the TIME coaching. TIME Kozhikode provides a coaching centre that is available right near our college. The next stage will be WAT or interview, in which they ask your subjects and general awareness so beware! Taken in 4th yr, 1 yr validity. GATE/ESE - These tests help you to get a job in PSUs or join M.Tech, so be good at your core subjects, preparing short notes from 1st year helps you a lot. The exam can be taken in the 3rd and 4th years (3 years validity). Usually, students opt for self preparations with question papers bought online. Online coaching is available too. Popular sites - ACE, MadeEasy. MS - If you are looking for an MS or a research-oriented career, start by working under some professor and try to publish a conference paper. These will aid your application process. Recommendation letters are all the more important for you, so choose your professor wisely. You also need a good GRE score (if you are aiming at US universities) or TOEFL (in countries like Germany, and Australia) so start preparing early for them. Apply for international academic exchange programs like DAAD early on to get those top-notch recommendations. Coaching services (if required) like Byjus help you with the whole process. LinkedIn profile: Start a LinkedIn profile and work on it, this help you a lot in your professional career later on. Online part-time work: Try to earn your own pocket money with easy part-time opportunities for creative writing, social media marketing etc available on Internshala. The skillset is useful and the money could keep you financially stable. College Life and Socializing Enjoy college life to the fullest: Yess, this sounds cliche but it is so very true. Try to explore things and get out of your comfort zone. It's not all about marks and labs, you NEED to have a life out of it. The best way to do this? Socialise :) Oh also, make sure you take advantage of Tathva and Ragam. With the right gang, it will be your best night in college. And seriously do take pictures of you in class and everyday life, you will be missing these when you look back. Join a club, association, committee, or sports: Technical clubs like RIG, Unwired, Aero Unwired, FOSSCELL, AI club, and IEEE definitely gives a shine to your resume and you will learn quite a lot if you are an active part of these. Departmental associations give you academic and managerial experience. Non-technical clubs like Club Mathematica, ISTE, IPF, LnD, DnD, ICA, MC, Enquire, Adventure, NSS, AV, HVG, IEDC, Forestry Club, Magazine Committee gives you an edge in terms of communicative skills and event coordination. And during Tathva and Ragam there are various cultural teams and organizing committees, try to join and have some fun. Last but not least, there's our institutional body SGC. Being an active part of any of these will be time-consuming so do balance out your attendance, assignment deadlines and grades. While it's a good experience if you get into a club, you will be absolutely fine otherwise with a lot of time to focus on yourself. Campus Resources and Essentials: Make good use of college resources. Our college spends a lot on both online and offline resources. We get institutional access to many paid software and student packs. Make sure to try out most of them. We'll try to put out a list of access provided by the campus. Food and Leisure Great food places to try: When you go back to offline sem, uphold our legacy and try out in Kattangal: 1) Wez Cafe 2) Waffle House 3) Decosta, Cafe Plus 4) Burger Lounge 5) Monarch Cafe 6) assi House 7) Bakehouse 8) Broast 9) Steam House 10) Maggi & chaat places And on behalf of us say Hi to the Coops chettan, Amul aunty, milma uncle, Micro uncle and uncle in MC. If you are looking for places to eat in Kozhikode, there are so many: 1)Sixth Avenue 2)Downtown 3)Paragon 4)Berry bomb The list goes on. Try Hi-Lite, and Focus malls too. (Most of these are expensive compared to mini, so do the math) Places to visit in Kozhikode: Not much honestly, all the food places and a lot of beaches look amazing when you go with friends. Do visit some of these beautiful beaches, it's worth the bus ride. Common rookie mistakes to avoid Losing your college ID card/grade card/library book Messing with the hostel wardens Forgetting to give the mess card asap Forgetting to put your phone on silent in class Forgetting your umbrella Leaving your food unattended in mini (crows duh). While there are so many more things we wish we could be on campus with you guys and tell, we are sure you will figure it out yourselves. Remember we seniors got your back if you ever need us and we'll be happy to help you. So keep calm and enjoy your college days! :')) DISCLAIMER: This piece of content was not made by me.

Join a club, association, committee, or sports: Technical clubs like RIG, Unwired, Aero Unwired, FOSSCELL, AI club, and IEEE definitely gives a shine to your resume and you will learn quite a lot if you are an active part of these. Departmental associations give you academic and managerial experience. Non-technical clubs like Club Mathematica, ISTE, IPF, LnD, DnD, ICA, MC, Enquire, Adventure, NSS, AV, HVG, IEDC, Forestry Club, Magazine Committee gives you an edge in terms of communicative skills and event coordination. And during Tathva and Ragam there are various cultural teams and organizing committees, try to join and have some fun. Last but not least, there's our institutional body SGC. Being an active part of any of these will be time-consuming so do balance out your attendance, assignment deadlines and grades. While it's a good experience if you get into a club, you will be absolutely fine otherwise with a lot of time to focus on yourself. Campus Resources and Essentials: Make good use of college resources. Our college spends a lot on both online and offline resources. We get institutional access to many paid software and student packs. Make sure to try out most of them. We'll try to put out a list of access provided by the campus. Food and Leisure Great food places to try: When you go back to offline sem, uphold our legacy and try out in Kattangal: 1) Wez Cafe 2) Waffle House 3) Decosta, Cafe Plus 4) Burger Lounge 5) Monarch Cafe 6) assi House 7) Bakehouse 8) Broast 9) Steam House 10) Maggi & chaat places And on behalf of us say Hi to the Coops chettan, Amul aunty, milma uncle, Micro uncle and uncle in MC. If you are looking for places to eat in Kozhikode, there are so many: 1)Sixth Avenue 2)Downtown 3)Paragon 4)Berry bomb The list goes on. Try Hi-Lite, and Focus malls too. (Most of these are expensive compared to mini, so do the math) Places to visit in Kozhikode: Not much honestly, all the food places and a lot of beaches look amazing when you go with friends. Do visit some of these beautiful beaches, it's worth the bus ride. Common rookie mistakes to avoid Losing your college ID card/grade card/library book Messing with the hostel wardens Forgetting to give the mess card asap Forgetting to put your phone on silent in class Forgetting your umbrella Leaving your food unattended in mini (crows duh). While there are so many more things we wish we could be on campus with you guys and tell, we are sure you will figure it out yourselves. Remember we seniors got your back if you ever need us and we'll be happy to help you. So keep calm and enjoy your college days! :')) DISCLAIMER: This piece of content was not made by me.

No matter which profession you later switch to, this will always be judged. The best time to get a high CGPA is, you guessed it right, your first year... Another point to remember your 2nd and 3rd years have the most important topics of your subject, so try not to doze off in class. Academic tips: Keep an alarm for almost everything – From waking up at 8 to a very strict TnP (Training and placement cell) deadline, it is better to have an alarm than go for attendance condonation but try not to make your roommate want to murder you. On that note, don't skip breakfast/lunch for your crazy daily schedule, our lovely canteens (Main, mini, micro, nano) have your back. Practice a fast walking speed to ace that \"Woke up at 7:55, had breakfast and now I'm in class\" level. Short notes – If you have plans to work on your subject itself or are confused about what to do in life, start by making short notes on your subjects. These not only help your college exams but also other career examinations and interviews in future.Trying to follow a study schedule and have 8+ hours of sleep will be almost every NITCian's dream. Places with AC like CCC, and Study Room can help you beat the heat at least while trying to complete portions. Enjoy some evening time on campus with your friends - Don't worry almost NOBODY gets time to study daily after all the classes and labs. The evening time needs to be utilised to relax a little. It's a GREAT thing if you can set aside some time every day to revise what was taught in class. Last min prep advice – a) Get short notes from Bhujjis(smart kids) b) Go through previous papers c) Finish easier portions d) Rather than reading the problems, try solving them by hand e) Hoard lots of food for exam nights f) Your friends are the best teachers on the eve of the exam g) God bless YouTube videos & Google Are you the quiet kind that doesn't get noticed much and trying to change that? The solution is simple - Bring a water bottle to class. Your valuable service will be appreciated throughout the class and you are the saviour to all sleepy heads trying to stay awake. Who knew becoming an Aquarius in class would get you friends? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Placements (Focus on coding, projects, internships) Do internships every sem break - Try to intern at a company ( or startup ) or projects under professors of IITs, NITs ( our profs do some cool research work too! ) or a training programme in PSUs like BSNL, NTPC, etc. IITs have paid internship programmes during summer whose submission deadlines are pretty early so keep an eye out for that. If you missed that, you can always personally mail profs who work on your interested area. (Mind you, in some unlucky cases it takes 100 emails to get a position) Orrrrr.... hit up the relatives/family friends you have in different companies/institutes and ask them about this. ( Internships for which you have to pay aren't preferred ) Do projects - Try online courses and projects. These are always a boost to your resume. When it comes to certain cases like Machine learning, it's better to start with a project and refer to theory side by side. (You HAVE to do the project on your own, not just to add a certification to your resume) Coding is a necessity - Whether you are in a core branch or CSE for B.tech, you need to know basic coding i.e. C++. Even core companies look for this so be safe and learn basic DSA and C++. If this interests you further, go on ahead with web dev or cloud computing, machine learning & AI or learning languages like Python/Java. You can also take up projects on your core subject with extensions to ML. (Beginner-friendly sites: Geekforgeeks, Hackerrank, Codechef, really any site is fine as long as you work. If you get stuck at any point there's always Google.) Basic knowledge of software - Get a basic knowledge of essential software like Excel, Photoshop, video editing etc. These skills will help you out in the long run. Have a co-curricular - Joining a club can really help you out in this aspect. Having some hobbies (other than eating and sleeping ofc) that you like will help you out in the HR round. Other than that work on your general awareness and interview skills. The usual advice, try reading the newspaper daily ( Bonus tip - the newspaper reading room in the library has the best AC on campus) Career Development Tips(Internships, projects, aptitude tests): Start with a rough resume - Prepare a rough resume in your first year and keep updating it throughout the years. This will help you immensely when it comes to placement processes. Aptitude tests - Most companies have an aptitude section so it is wise to be reasonably good at them. Many sites provide you with free aptitude tests, one of the popular ones being - https://www.indiabix.com/ Placement experiences - Go through the placement experiences of your seniors ( usually put up by departmental associations ) to get a rough idea of company profiles. Prepare for the commonly asked interview questions and most importantly projects on your resume when you get shortlisted. Lastly, on a fun note, get blessed by our Rajpath crows to get a placement. It's true, some people vouch for it ;) Career choices (MBA, GATE/ESE, MS): It's normal to feel confused about what to do after college, but most of you will figure out what you want ( or what you don't want ) by 3rd year. If you are still confused, try different things just go ahead with the best opportunity you get and hope it's for the best. Some of the popular choices are given below. These are some of the important points for a beginner, go on to further research these later on. MBA - Requires preparation for CAT, try some coaching centre in 3rd yr or do self-preparation. The most popular ones are TIME and Career Launcher. Club Mathematica usually partners with TIME, to conduct a scholarship test, which will offer you a discount on the TIME coaching. TIME Kozhikode provides a coaching centre that is available right near our college. The next stage will be WAT or interview, in which they ask your subjects and general awareness so beware! Taken in 4th yr, 1 yr validity. GATE/ESE - These tests help you to get a job in PSUs or join M.Tech, so be good at your core subjects, preparing short notes from 1st year helps you a lot. The exam can be taken in the 3rd and 4th years (3 years validity). Usually, students opt for self preparations with question papers bought online. Online coaching is available too. Popular sites - ACE, MadeEasy. MS - If you are looking for an MS or a research-oriented career, start by working under some professor and try to publish a conference paper. These will aid your application process. Recommendation letters are all the more important for you, so choose your professor wisely. You also need a good GRE score (if you are aiming at US universities) or TOEFL (in countries like Germany, and Australia) so start preparing early for them. Apply for international academic exchange programs like DAAD early on to get those top-notch recommendations. Coaching services (if required) like Byjus help you with the whole process. LinkedIn profile: Start a LinkedIn profile and work on it, this help you a lot in your professional career later on. Online part-time work: Try to earn your own pocket money with easy part-time opportunities for creative writing, social media marketing etc available on Internshala. The skillset is useful and the money could keep you financially stable. College Life and Socializing Enjoy college life to the fullest: Yess, this sounds cliche but it is so very true. Try to explore things and get out of your comfort zone. It's not all about marks and labs, you NEED to have a life out of it. The best way to do this? Socialise :) Oh also, make sure you take advantage of Tathva and Ragam. With the right gang, it will be your best night in college.

I first step foot to the NITC Campus at around mid-2019. I'll be honest I had no clue about the rich history and culture of campus that day. Just like every other fresher, the first thing I searched on YouTube was about Tathva and Ragam. I loved the trailers and aftermovies of all those events so much that I considered everyone who got featured in any of them as a celebrity. I had a chance to meet quite a few of them and had the privilege to be friends with them. This Blog entry is an effort to document our lives here as NITCians so that those who come after us also have insight into how we lived, how we endured and tackled engineering and other problems with what we have. I'll break this into different years and try to link everything to their pages so that there is more info have fun reading and maybe write your own by creating an account. First Year For most of my peers and myself, it was the first time staying away from family. Sure there were a lot of students who were staying in institutes like Brilliant Pala, Chaithanya Narayana, and Kota for a year or more to crack JEE that had already gone through this. But arguably we had more freedom. Or so we thought. I see many of the senior batch kids even from my batch that used to envy b21s and batches below for the freedom they got to enjoy. Pre-covid campus and hostels were highly restrictive when it came to first year and females. Hostel committee meetings were a nightmare for many and the number of students who got mouthfuls for \"Breaking rules\" was not few. The rules especially for first years were set for their safety. To tackle ragging first years were strongly discouraged and even punished for having interaction with seniors or going to places where the seniors don't want you to go. I used to think that the logic the hostel administration was following was such that, \"Senior students won't rag you if we rag you first\". Still, with all the shackles in place, the first sem was more eventful including SAC onam, carpe diem, and ofc Tathva. Darshan Raval and Infra were the 2 extreme peaks of pleasure and pain we had in the sem. I also joined the Students' Commune which was started by some of our seniors. The commune was an unofficial student organization that believed in the need for student unity and political awareness to have a healthier campus. Soon after tathva the campus started getting Ready for Ragam. The Home Team Inductions had started and like everyone else, I showed up to NLHC to test my luck. After multiple rounds of screening and war between seniors for juniors I got into the NITC Mime Team. NITC Mime Team The journey with the Mime team members to Ragam was physically and mentally draining but instead of weakening us, the journey had made us stronger. We were at our physical peak during Ragam after the drills we went through and our minds were sharp. From day 0 to day of Ragam we underwent moments of joy and sorrow and were taken into the Mimehood. The night before Ragam after going through everything according to creed we played the final dress rehearsal before all the Mime seniors and super seniors. with them applauding as a mark of approval we were ready to play Ragam Mime the next day. We all broke our hearts when the result came and we had lost the 10-year streak of the first price and that was the emotional all-time low we had. The wound didn't heal for a long time until we went to Christ University and secured first place from 6 colleges that participated. The journey to Christ was a broken, confusing, and depressing one, but the result made sure we came back to campus with our heads high. Now we had very few days on campus post-Ragam as COVID-19 had started spreading all over the globe. As cases started to get reported in Kerala the institute had declared 1 week holiday and we all went home thinking we'll be back after a week. WE DIDN'T! Stuck at home disconnected what was left of semester 2 was completed online. And b16s had to leave campus in one of the saddest ways imaginable. Second Year Online had become the \"New Normal\" when we started the second-year classes. It was at around this point when one of my seniors asked me in a random WhatsApp chat \" Aren't you a communist ? Which Linux OS are you using ?\" even tho I wasn't one at that time (I was slanting towards the socialist side of the political map) The question he asked was hurt me in ways I don't understand even now and I wiped my laptop and thus began my journey using GNU/Linux. It has to be noted that this random chat is fr a cannon event and chances are I'd have not reached my current career path nor hosted this MediaWiki instance.

I first step foot to the NITC Campus at around mid-2019. I'll be honest I had no clue about the rich history and culture of campus that day. Just like every other fresher, the first thing I searched on YouTube was about Tathva and Ragam. I loved the trailers and aftermovies of all those events so much that I considered everyone who got featured in any of them as a celebrity. I had a chance to meet quite a few of them and had the privilege to be friends with them. This Blog entry is an effort to document our lives here as NITCians so that those who come after us also have insight into how we lived, how we endured and tackled engineering and other problems with what we have. I'll break this into different years and try to link everything to their pages so that there is more info have fun reading and maybe write your own by creating an account. First Year For most of my peers and myself, it was the first time staying away from family. Sure there were a lot of students who were staying in institutes like Brilliant Pala, Chaithanya Narayana, and Kota for a year or more to crack JEE that had already gone through this. But arguably we had more freedom. Or so we thought. I see many of the senior batch kids even from my batch that used to envy b21s and batches below for the freedom they got to enjoy. Pre-covid campus and hostels were highly restrictive when it came to first year and females. Hostel committee meetings were a nightmare for many and the number of students who got mouthfuls for \"Breaking rules\" was not few. The rules especially for first years were set for their safety. To tackle ragging first years were strongly discouraged and even punished for having interaction with seniors or going to places where the seniors don't want you to go. I used to think that the logic the hostel administration was following was such that, \"Senior students won't rag you if we rag you first\". Still, with all the shackles in place, the first sem was more eventful including SAC onam, carpe diem, and ofc Tathva. Darshan Raval and Infra were the 2 extreme peaks of pleasure and pain we had in the sem. I also joined the Students' Commune which was started by some of our seniors. The commune was an unofficial student organization that believed in the need for student unity and political awareness to have a healthier campus. Soon after tathva the campus started getting Ready for Ragam. The Home Team Inductions had started and like everyone else, I showed up to NLHC to test my luck. After multiple rounds of screening and war between seniors for juniors I got into the NITC Mime Team. NITC Mime Team The journey with the Mime team members to Ragam was physically and mentally draining but instead of weakening us, the journey had made us stronger. We were at our physical peak during Ragam after the drills we went through and our minds were sharp. From day 0 to day of Ragam we underwent moments of joy and sorrow and were taken into the Mimehood. The night before Ragam after going through everything according to creed we played the final dress rehearsal before all the Mime seniors and super seniors. with them applauding as a mark of approval we were ready to play Ragam Mime the next day. We all broke our hearts when the result came and we had lost the 10-year streak of the first price and that was the emotional all-time low we had. The wound didn't heal for a long time until we went to Christ University and secured first place from 6 colleges that participated. The journey to Christ was a broken, confusing, and depressing one, but the result made sure we came back to campus with our heads high. Now we had very few days on campus post-Ragam as COVID-19 had started spreading all over the globe. As cases started to get reported in Kerala the institute had declared 1 week holiday and we all went home thinking we'll be back after a week. WE DIDN'T! Stuck at home disconnected what was left of semester 2 was completed online. And b16s had to leave campus in one of the saddest ways imaginable. Second Year Online had become the \"New Normal\" when we started the second-year classes. It was at around this point when one of my seniors asked me in a random WhatsApp chat \" Aren't you a communist ? Which Linux OS are you using ?\" even tho I wasn't one at that time (I was slanting towards the socialist side of the political map) The question he asked was hurt me in ways I don't understand even now and I wiped my laptop and thus began my journey using GNU/Linux. It has to be noted that this random chat is fr a cannon event and chances are I'd have not reached my current career path nor hosted this MediaWiki instance. I was never good at making partitions and that's mostly the reason I wanted to single-boot Ubuntu at that time instead of dual-booting. At around this time, I had lost my Android phone (Nexus 6P) RIP and unlike the current WhatsApp web we take for granted the feature to keep the web working without a phone connected to the internet was not possible.

And with that I got to train the Mime juniors along with other Mime seniors. All the Home teams made their comeback and performed for the Jubilee.After the Jubilee event the celebrations took a new twist as NAVARAGAM started at the basket ball court. Seeing the \"FUN TIMES\" the student's in campus were having from watching social media posts many of the students decided to enter the campus to have a chance to have the fun they were dued to. This however was faced by a huge hurdle of quarantine. to put things in perspective the existing criteria for students to enter the bio bubble was to stay in quarantine at the old mega hostel for 7-14 days and then get tested and only then they could enter the main campus. along with this no one was allowed to go outside campus (at least on paper). A large inflow of students was expected for the much awaited Navaragam to bid farewell to 2021 and embrace 2022.As expected the crowd had a blast and together we welcomed the beginning of 2022. The teaser video for Ragam 2022 was also streamed to the students and hope of Ragam reigniting once again post COVID put warmth in all our hearts. This was however run into more issues as large number of covid positive cases started to be reported from inside the campus. TheB18's were already being called back to return back to campus and continue rest of their semester in offline mode. As the number of infections went above the administration decided to send all the kids back home and also cancelled the rejoining of B18's too. Most of us thought this was their final bid to campus and like the B17s and B16s before them they'd also have to spend their last days in campus from their home itself. much of the planned programmes including the Anuragam 2022 were in crisis. Yet under the leadership of the Cultural Affairs Secretery, It was decided to conduct anuragam in an online mode. With exciting events including an online blind date the anuragam 2022 put up a good fight to spread love at the trying times of covid. Soon after the MHRD issued an order demanding all the institutes under them to begin the offline classes immediately and with that the B18's who were called, send back just few weeks prior were called back again. And this time it was in a full swing. Everyone started coming back to the campus and the campus started breathing again and was full of students all over. The third year then came to a peaceful end with Ragam 2022. Don't miss New articles College Survival 101 Freedom, Education and Free Software Looking Back Now You Can Blog here.

Lets get into the basics. Docker Image - It is an executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application. They include code, libraries and everything required for your software. Think of it like a dish recipe. You can create your own image using a DockerFile using a base image like alpine, or you could check for a prebuilt one on https://hub.docker.com/. Docker Container - It is a running instance of an image, almost like dish prepared using the recipe. In formal terms, each container is an isolated environment where the application runs. Since an application may require multiple services, just like wiki requires mediawiki, nginx/apache2 and mariadb, we can activate multiple containers using Docker Compose file (docker-compose.yml).

Some prefer to come here on the morning, others celebrate their birthdays and sometimes the club events such as Open Book Reading or Kaapikootam.

If someone from the NITC family unfortunately passes away then their mourning ceremony is performed here. When the administration decided to impose a curfew on the April of 2024 then SAC kept a special session of general meeting here.

You are under no obligation to join them, but they can be very helpful and provide a sense of belonging. Make friends if you can. Meet right seniors if you can. Beware of : Being threatened to do anything that you are not comfortable doing or going to places you are not not comfortable going. Don't be afraid. Travel Guide Buses are the preferred way of travel for most broke college students like you and me. Buses to and from NITC will have REC or NITC written on it in English. Coding Guide If you really are determined to get that 'IIT' package, your best way of doing that is by starting to learn how to code. As early as possible. Get help from seniors, ask them questions. People are helpful, you don't have to be lost and lonely. Try to join clubs, organizations and events. Some of the clubs that induct first year students are : GDSC NITC , FOSSCell, etc. Try out coding websites like leetcode. Try out youtube channels teaching you about different tech domains and providing tutorials. Explore as much as you can in first year. Friendship Guide If you have friends, great. If you don't, look around you might find some idiot who's lonely inside and that will be your friend subsequently making the college experience a little less mundane. If you can't make friends, make sure to be polite, present and positive. And try not to make any enemies in first year itself.

Topics in Logic Design: Number theory and Boolean algebra Design and analysis of combinational logic Design of digital logic devices Design and analysis of sequential logic Grading System (2023 onwards) Breakdown Mid semester - 30%End semester - 30%Semester Project - 30% Semester Project The semester project involves making two projects using behavioral modelling and gate level modelling. The modelling must be done on the ModelSim software made by Intel. The mark breakdown for the project are as follows: 5 marks - Topic selection and proposal15 marks - Gate level modelling20 marks - Behavioral modeling You are given the option to either select two different topics for behavioral and gate level modelling or a single a topic for both. Overall experience In the case of B23 batch, the project was shortened to only the gate-level application due to the shortening of our semester as well as the onset of online classes during that period. Therefore, all 40 marks were taken from only the gate level applications. Creating a complex project suing gate level that can justify 40 marks turned out to be quite challenging and was therefore very difficult for most students. The project would have had more options in terms of ideas and implementation if we were also given the option to use gate level. Furthermore faculty expectations are also quite high for this project, making scoring marks difficult. Instructions for future batches You will only be given basic syntax classes:Do not expect the faculty to show something fancy in class. B23 batch was shown how to make a full adder. You can figure out the rest and you are expected to do so. Read and try to learn from the GitHub projects instead of YouTube: Surf the internet or ask seniors for this. You will learn more from this than any YouTube video. Faculty project expectations and lack of resources can be frustrating:There is a high chance of getting frustrated and overwhelmed by this. Grind through it boys and girls. Retrieved from ‘https://wiki.fosscell.org/index.php?title=Logic_Design&oldid=2368’",

No matter which profession you later switch to, this will always be judged. The best time to get a high CGPA is, you guessed it right, your first year... Another point to remember your 2nd and 3rd years have the most important topics of your subject, so try not to doze off in class. Academic tips: Keep an alarm for almost everything – From waking up at 8 to a very strict TnP (Training and placement cell) deadline, it is better to have an alarm than go for attendance condonation but try not to make your roommate want to murder you. On that note, don't skip breakfast/lunch for your crazy daily schedule, our lovely canteens (Main, mini, micro, nano) have your back. Practice a fast walking speed to ace that \"Woke up at 7:55, had breakfast and now I'm in class\" level. Short notes – If you have plans to work on your subject itself or are confused about what to do in life, start by making short notes on your subjects. These not only help your college exams but also other career examinations and interviews in future.Trying to follow a study schedule and have 8+ hours of sleep will be almost every NITCian's dream. Places with AC like CCC, and Study Room can help you beat the heat at least while trying to complete portions. Enjoy some evening time on campus with your friends - Don't worry almost NOBODY gets time to study daily after all the classes and labs. The evening time needs to be utilised to relax a little. It's a GREAT thing if you can set aside some time every day to revise what was taught in class. Last min prep advice – a) Get short notes from Bhujjis(smart kids) b) Go through previous papers c) Finish easier portions d) Rather than reading the problems, try solving them by hand e) Hoard lots of food for exam nights f) Your friends are the best teachers on the eve of the exam g) God bless YouTube videos & Google Are you the quiet kind that doesn't get noticed much and trying to change that? The solution is simple - Bring a water bottle to class. Your valuable service will be appreciated throughout the class and you are the saviour to all sleepy heads trying to stay awake. Who knew becoming an Aquarius in class would get you friends? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Placements (Focus on coding, projects, internships) Do internships every sem break - Try to intern at a company ( or startup ) or projects under professors of IITs, NITs ( our profs do some cool research work too! ) or a training programme in PSUs like BSNL, NTPC, etc. IITs have paid internship programmes during summer whose submission deadlines are pretty early so keep an eye out for that. If you missed that, you can always personally mail profs who work on your interested area. (Mind you, in some unlucky cases it takes 100 emails to get a position) Orrrrr.... hit up the relatives/family friends you have in different companies/institutes and ask them about this. ( Internships for which you have to pay aren't preferred ) Do projects - Try online courses and projects. These are always a boost to your resume. When it comes to certain cases like Machine learning, it's better to start with a project and refer to theory side by side. (You HAVE to do the project on your own, not just to add a certification to your resume) Coding is a necessity - Whether you are in a core branch or CSE for B.tech, you need to know basic coding i.e. C++. Even core companies look for this so be safe and learn basic DSA and C++. If this interests you further, go on ahead with web dev or cloud computing, machine learning & AI or learning languages like Python/Java. You can also take up projects on your core subject with extensions to ML. (Beginner-friendly sites: Geekforgeeks, Hackerrank, Codechef, really any site is fine as long as you work. If you get stuck at any point there's always Google.) Basic knowledge of software - Get a basic knowledge of essential software like Excel, Photoshop, video editing etc. These skills will help you out in the long run. Have a co-curricular - Joining a club can really help you out in this aspect. Having some hobbies (other than eating and sleeping ofc) that you like will help you out in the HR round. Other than that work on your general awareness and interview skills. The usual advice, try reading the newspaper daily ( Bonus tip - the newspaper reading room in the library has the best AC on campus) Career Development Tips(Internships, projects, aptitude tests): Start with a rough resume - Prepare a rough resume in your first year and keep updating it throughout the years. This will help you immensely when it comes to placement processes. Aptitude tests - Most companies have an aptitude section so it is wise to be reasonably good at them. Many sites provide you with free aptitude tests, one of the popular ones being - https://www.indiabix.com/ Placement experiences - Go through the placement experiences of your seniors ( usually put up by departmental associations ) to get a rough idea of company profiles. Prepare for the commonly asked interview questions and most importantly projects on your resume when you get shortlisted. Lastly, on a fun note, get blessed by our Rajpath crows to get a placement. It's true, some people vouch for it ;) Career choices (MBA, GATE/ESE, MS): It's normal to feel confused about what to do after college, but most of you will figure out what you want ( or what you don't want ) by 3rd year. If you are still confused, try different things just go ahead with the best opportunity you get and hope it's for the best. Some of the popular choices are given below. These are some of the important points for a beginner, go on to further research these later on. MBA - Requires preparation for CAT, try some coaching centre in 3rd yr or do self-preparation. The most popular ones are TIME and Career Launcher. Club Mathematica usually partners with TIME, to conduct a scholarship test, which will offer you a discount on the TIME coaching. TIME Kozhikode provides a coaching centre that is available right near our college. The next stage will be WAT or interview, in which they ask your subjects and general awareness so beware! Taken in 4th yr, 1 yr validity. GATE/ESE - These tests help you to get a job in PSUs or join M.Tech, so be good at your core subjects, preparing short notes from 1st year helps you a lot. The exam can be taken in the 3rd and 4th years (3 years validity). Usually, students opt for self preparations with question papers bought online. Online coaching is available too. Popular sites - ACE, MadeEasy. MS - If you are looking for an MS or a research-oriented career, start by working under some professor and try to publish a conference paper. These will aid your application process. Recommendation letters are all the more important for you, so choose your professor wisely. You also need a good GRE score (if you are aiming at US universities) or TOEFL (in countries like Germany, and Australia) so start preparing early for them. Apply for international academic exchange programs like DAAD early on to get those top-notch recommendations. Coaching services (if required) like Byjus help you with the whole process. LinkedIn profile: Start a LinkedIn profile and work on it, this help you a lot in your professional career later on. Online part-time work: Try to earn your own pocket money with easy part-time opportunities for creative writing, social media marketing etc available on Internshala. The skillset is useful and the money could keep you financially stable. College Life and Socializing Enjoy college life to the fullest: Yess, this sounds cliche but it is so very true. Try to explore things and get out of your comfort zone. It's not all about marks and labs, you NEED to have a life out of it. The best way to do this? Socialise :) Oh also, make sure you take advantage of Tathva and Ragam. With the right gang, it will be your best night in college. And seriously do take pictures of you in class and everyday life, you will be missing these when you look back. Join a club, association, committee, or sports: Technical clubs like RIG, Unwired, Aero Unwired, FOSSCELL, AI club, and IEEE definitely gives a shine to your resume and you will learn quite a lot if you are an active part of these. Departmental associations give you academic and managerial experience. Non-technical clubs like Club Mathematica, ISTE, IPF, LnD, DnD, ICA, MC, Enquire, Adventure, NSS, AV, HVG, IEDC, Forestry Club, Magazine Committee gives you an edge in terms of communicative skills and event coordination. And during Tathva and Ragam there are various cultural teams and organizing committees, try to join and have some fun. Last but not least, there's our institutional body SGC. Being an active part of any of these will be time-consuming so do balance out your attendance, assignment deadlines and grades. While it's a good experience if you get into a club, you will be absolutely fine otherwise with a lot of time to focus on yourself. Campus Resources and Essentials: Make good use of college resources. Our college spends a lot on both online and offline resources. We get institutional access to many paid software and student packs. Make sure to try out most of them. We'll try to put out a list of access provided by the campus. Food and Leisure Great food places to try: When you go back to offline sem, uphold our legacy and try out in Kattangal: 1) Wez Cafe 2) Waffle House 3) Decosta, Cafe Plus 4) Burger Lounge 5) Monarch Cafe 6) assi House 7) Bakehouse 8) Broast 9) Steam House 10) Maggi & chaat places And on behalf of us say Hi to the Coops chettan, Amul aunty, milma uncle, Micro uncle and uncle in MC. If you are looking for places to eat in Kozhikode, there are so many: 1)Sixth Avenue 2)Downtown 3)Paragon 4)Berry bomb The list goes on. Try Hi-Lite, and Focus malls too. (Most of these are expensive compared to mini, so do the math) Places to visit in Kozhikode: Not much honestly, all the food places and a lot of beaches look amazing when you go with friends. Do visit some of these beautiful beaches, it's worth the bus ride. Common rookie mistakes to avoid Losing your college ID card/grade card/library book Messing with the hostel wardens Forgetting to give the mess card asap Forgetting to put your phone on silent in class Forgetting your umbrella Leaving your food unattended in mini (crows duh). While there are so many more things we wish we could be on campus with you guys and tell, we are sure you will figure it out yourselves. Remember we seniors got your back if you ever need us and we'll be happy to help you. So keep calm and enjoy your college days! :')) DISCLAIMER: This piece of content was not made by me.

(Mind you, in some unlucky cases it takes 100 emails to get a position) Orrrrr.... hit up the relatives/family friends you have in different companies/institutes and ask them about this. ( Internships for which you have to pay aren't preferred ) Do projects - Try online courses and projects. These are always a boost to your resume. When it comes to certain cases like Machine learning, it's better to start with a project and refer to theory side by side. (You HAVE to do the project on your own, not just to add a certification to your resume) Coding is a necessity - Whether you are in a core branch or CSE for B.tech, you need to know basic coding i.e. C++. Even core companies look for this so be safe and learn basic DSA and C++. If this interests you further, go on ahead with web dev or cloud computing, machine learning & AI or learning languages like Python/Java. You can also take up projects on your core subject with extensions to ML. (Beginner-friendly sites: Geekforgeeks, Hackerrank, Codechef, really any site is fine as long as you work. If you get stuck at any point there's always Google.) Basic knowledge of software - Get a basic knowledge of essential software like Excel, Photoshop, video editing etc. These skills will help you out in the long run. Have a co-curricular - Joining a club can really help you out in this aspect. Having some hobbies (other than eating and sleeping ofc) that you like will help you out in the HR round. Other than that work on your general awareness and interview skills. The usual advice, try reading the newspaper daily ( Bonus tip - the newspaper reading room in the library has the best AC on campus) Career Development Tips(Internships, projects, aptitude tests): Start with a rough resume - Prepare a rough resume in your first year and keep updating it throughout the years. This will help you immensely when it comes to placement processes. Aptitude tests - Most companies have an aptitude section so it is wise to be reasonably good at them. Many sites provide you with free aptitude tests, one of the popular ones being - https://www.indiabix.com/ Placement experiences - Go through the placement experiences of your seniors ( usually put up by departmental associations ) to get a rough idea of company profiles. Prepare for the commonly asked interview questions and most importantly projects on your resume when you get shortlisted. Lastly, on a fun note, get blessed by our Rajpath crows to get a placement. It's true, some people vouch for it ;) Career choices (MBA, GATE/ESE, MS): It's normal to feel confused about what to do after college, but most of you will figure out what you want ( or what you don't want ) by 3rd year. If you are still confused, try different things just go ahead with the best opportunity you get and hope it's for the best. Some of the popular choices are given below. These are some of the important points for a beginner, go on to further research these later on. MBA - Requires preparation for CAT, try some coaching centre in 3rd yr or do self-preparation. The most popular ones are TIME and Career Launcher. Club Mathematica usually partners with TIME, to conduct a scholarship test, which will offer you a discount on the TIME coaching. TIME Kozhikode provides a coaching centre that is available right near our college. The next stage will be WAT or interview, in which they ask your subjects and general awareness so beware! Taken in 4th yr, 1 yr validity. GATE/ESE - These tests help you to get a job in PSUs or join M.Tech, so be good at your core subjects, preparing short notes from 1st year helps you a lot. The exam can be taken in the 3rd and 4th years (3 years validity). Usually, students opt for self preparations with question papers bought online. Online coaching is available too. Popular sites - ACE, MadeEasy. MS - If you are looking for an MS or a research-oriented career, start by working under some professor and try to publish a conference paper. These will aid your application process. Recommendation letters are all the more important for you, so choose your professor wisely. You also need a good GRE score (if you are aiming at US universities) or TOEFL (in countries like Germany, and Australia) so start preparing early for them. Apply for international academic exchange programs like DAAD early on to get those top-notch recommendations. Coaching services (if required) like Byjus help you with the whole process. LinkedIn profile: Start a LinkedIn profile and work on it, this help you a lot in your professional career later on. Online part-time work: Try to earn your own pocket money with easy part-time opportunities for creative writing, social media marketing etc available on Internshala. The skillset is useful and the money could keep you financially stable. College Life and Socializing Enjoy college life to the fullest: Yess, this sounds cliche but it is so very true. Try to explore things and get out of your comfort zone. It's not all about marks and labs, you NEED to have a life out of it. The best way to do this? Socialise :) Oh also, make sure you take advantage of Tathva and Ragam. With the right gang, it will be your best night in college. And seriously do take pictures of you in class and everyday life, you will be missing these when you look back. Join a club, association, committee, or sports: Technical clubs like RIG, Unwired, Aero Unwired, FOSSCELL, AI club, and IEEE definitely gives a shine to your resume and you will learn quite a lot if you are an active part of these. Departmental associations give you academic and managerial experience. Non-technical clubs like Club Mathematica, ISTE, IPF, LnD, DnD, ICA, MC, Enquire, Adventure, NSS, AV, HVG, IEDC, Forestry Club, Magazine Committee gives you an edge in terms of communicative skills and event coordination. And during Tathva and Ragam there are various cultural teams and organizing committees, try to join and have some fun. Last but not least, there's our institutional body SGC. Being an active part of any of these will be time-consuming so do balance out your attendance, assignment deadlines and grades. While it's a good experience if you get into a club, you will be absolutely fine otherwise with a lot of time to focus on yourself. Campus Resources and Essentials: Make good use of college resources. Our college spends a lot on both online and offline resources. We get institutional access to many paid software and student packs. Make sure to try out most of them. We'll try to put out a list of access provided by the campus. Food and Leisure Great food places to try: When you go back to offline sem, uphold our legacy and try out in Kattangal: 1) Wez Cafe 2) Waffle House 3) Decosta, Cafe Plus 4) Burger Lounge 5) Monarch Cafe 6) assi House 7) Bakehouse 8) Broast 9) Steam House 10) Maggi & chaat places And on behalf of us say Hi to the Coops chettan, Amul aunty, milma uncle, Micro uncle and uncle in MC. If you are looking for places to eat in Kozhikode, there are so many: 1)Sixth Avenue 2)Downtown 3)Paragon 4)Berry bomb The list goes on. Try Hi-Lite, and Focus malls too. (Most of these are expensive compared to mini, so do the math) Places to visit in Kozhikode: Not much honestly, all the food places and a lot of beaches look amazing when you go with friends. Do visit some of these beautiful beaches, it's worth the bus ride. Common rookie mistakes to avoid Losing your college ID card/grade card/library book Messing with the hostel wardens Forgetting to give the mess card asap Forgetting to put your phone on silent in class Forgetting your umbrella Leaving your food unattended in mini (crows duh). While there are so many more things we wish we could be on campus with you guys and tell, we are sure you will figure it out yourselves. Remember we seniors got your back if you ever need us and we'll be happy to help you. So keep calm and enjoy your college days! :')) DISCLAIMER: This piece of content was not made by me.

      "content": "Friday Night FOSS Aug’23 Friday Night Foss started as an initiative by FOSSCELL to help create a community gathering of people .The first edition of Friday Night FOSS took place on August 11th, 2023, marking the start of a series of monthly get-togethers. This mini-hackathon is more than just a chance for people with similar interests to work together on building free and open-source software; it's also a space for sharing knowledge and expertise in the ever-growing world of technology. During the event, participants got deep into refining their software ideas. The atmosphere was full of excitement as people explored different ways their ideas could be used, discussed the details, and came up with innovative solutions. The strategic planning sessions were crucial, helping participants create strong initial versions of their projects, known as minimum viable products (MVPs). The event showcased exceptional creativity, providing an environment where innovative ideas thrived. There was a strong sense of collaboration in the air, with individuals from various backgrounds coming together with a shared goal of advancing open-source projects. Members of FOSSCell played a key role as mentors, not only sharing their expertise but also contributing to a sense of camaraderie by addressing questions and offering valuable insights. The success of the event goes beyond the projects initiated; it's also about the dynamic learning and growth that took place. As the community continues to flourish, Friday Night FOSS demonstrates the power of collective effort in shaping the future of free and open-source software development.

The event took place on October 18th at 7:30 PM in the NSL Lab of the IT Lab Complex, drawing a diverse group of participants eager to learn. The session, led by dedicated FOSSCELL members and volunteers, offered an interactive learning experience that focused on Flask, a popular microframework known for its simplicity and versatility. What made the session even more interesting was the journey of Flask, which started as a small community project and has since become a key tool in the developer's toolkit worldwide. Throughout the evening, participants got hands-on experience with Flask by working on a simple calculator project. Using text editors like Nano and Vim, they explored Flask’s core functionalities, such as routing, templates, and handling HTTP requests. The small group setting allowed for personal guidance from the FOSS volunteers, making it easier for students to grasp the basics of backend development. This practical, collaborative environment encouraged attendees to ask questions and troubleshoot their code in real time, giving them a solid foundation for future exploration into Python and Flask. Adding a touch of celebration to the technical learning, the session coincided with the anniversary of KDE (K Desktop Environment), an iconic part of the open-source movement. After the coding portion of the session, participants gathered for a small cake-cutting ceremony to mark the occasion, blending the learning experience with a sense of community and festivity. It was a memorable evening that not only expanded participants' coding skills but also highlighted the importance of open-source collaboration in shaping the future of software development.

The Guest House at NIT Calicut has only a few rooms and has already been booked for committed activities of the Institute. Therefore, it is regretted to inform that the guest house facility will not be available for newly joining students/ parents in the month of November 2022. City of Calicut (Kozhikode) has multiple options for stay and is well connected to the Institute. The nearest commercial centre of Kunnamangalam also has few options available for stay. The students and parents are advised to book lodging facility as per their budget, choice and convenience.

Almost all students knew C++ and didn’t know Perl. So, yaay! They hadn’t been spoilt by Perl and we knew it would be exciting to introduce them to a clean language like Python to C++ students.

It is a laboratory course that demands you to learn things from the basics of hardware like flip-flops to writing code for Single Cycel MIPS processor on your own at a very short period of time. The course mostly deals with a Hardware Descriptive Language, Verilog. Most of TA's are not very proficient in Verilog hardware simulation and since it is a laboratory course, you will a handful if any classes by the professors, but fear not, your seniors have you covered. Hardware Lab Website Started as a open source project in the summer of 2022, to contribute towards making the HWLab more easier, the hardware lab website acts as an all in one destination to equip you with the theory and implementation of all topics that you will require. Visit hwlabnitc.github.io for more info. Practicing the given assignments are mostly enough to score marks . the FSM assignment and the single cycle processor are the the harder ones from the assingnments.

Yet only a few of the images / photographs of the same are publicly available. Countless photographs have been lost and will never see daylight again. As a solution to this the Wiki NITC encourages users ie NITC Students and others to proactively upload as many images of significance to the Wikimedia Commons. Wikimedia Commons Provide Free and Unlimited storage to any Photographs (Read More in the link attatched above) and collecting and uploading images of events ranging from the smallest club, cultural events to Tathva and Ragam ensures that they remain accessible throughout time. I personally believe using commons instead of solutions like Google Drive to store Event Photographs will be benificial for us as a community. I've had first hand experience serving in the media Committee of Tathva and Ragam that a large number of Images related to both these events have been Lost. I Once again request you all to please checkout Wikimedia Commons and start uploading images. Retrieved from ‘https://wiki.fosscell.org/index.php?title=Commons_drive&oldid=2488’",

This mini-hackathon is more than just a chance for people with similar interests to work together on building free and open-source software; it's also a space for sharing knowledge and expertise in the ever-growing world of technology. During the event, participants got deep into refining their software ideas. The atmosphere was full of excitement as people explored different ways their ideas could be used, discussed the details, and came up with innovative solutions. The strategic planning sessions were crucial, helping participants create strong initial versions of their projects, known as minimum viable products (MVPs). The event showcased exceptional creativity, providing an environment where innovative ideas thrived. There was a strong sense of collaboration in the air, with individuals from various backgrounds coming together with a shared goal of advancing open-source projects. Members of FOSSCell played a key role as mentors, not only sharing their expertise but also contributing to a sense of camaraderie by addressing questions and offering valuable insights. The success of the event goes beyond the projects initiated; it's also about the dynamic learning and growth that took place. As the community continues to flourish, Friday Night FOSS demonstrates the power of collective effort in shaping the future of free and open-source software development.

I hardly saw any faculty running around, except for Amarjeet. The faculty was more of facilitiating the event rather than running the event and their pulls on the event was not quite obvious, if any.

Participants delved into Flask’s inherent simplicity and versatility, seamlessly transitioning from theoretical concepts to practical application as they crafted their own basic calculators. The workshop was expertly facilitated by Naveen SD, a distinguished former member of FOSSCell, whose contributions significantly enhanced the learning experience. By the conclusion of the evening, attendees emerged not only with practical skills but also with a profound appreciation for the intricacies of developing dynamic web applications. This event marked another significant achievement in FOSSCell’s commitment to nurturing open-source skills and fostering innovation within the community.

      "content": "SSL SSL lab : source SSL which stands for Software Systems Lab is one among many labs in the IT lab complex. This lab was established in 2006. The objective of this laboratory is to provide the infrastructure for conducting the regular labs (Network Lab, Data Structures Lab, DBMS Lab, Hardware Lab , Compiler Lab, OS Lab and Programming Languages Lab) and project works for the BTech and MCA Programs. The lab is equipped with state of the art servers, desktops and software (Linux and compilers for C, C++, Perl, TCL, PHP, Java, Python, etc.). Official website Entry in the lab is only allowed for CSED students with valid ID card. Although officially it is not a place of hangout, SSL hosts some of the best minds in the the department as they collaborate and innovate in this air conditioned temple of Computer Science. SSL Student Admins The student admins of SSL are volunteers that handle the usage of the lab servers and systems. They are allowed to stay past 5PM to keep the lab open to CSED students as a place to study. Inducted by the previous SSL student admins, they are linux administrators that love to learn. Specifications of Machines in SSL The SSL hosts Dell Optiplex 7010 systems with a 3rd Gen i5, 12 GiB of RAM, 512 GB SATA SSD and 1.0 TB Hard Drives. These Optiplex machines come with standard dell keyboards and mice from 2014 era with a 1366x768 Monitor connected via VGA. They are being slowly replaced with HP Pavilions, with 10th Gen i5, 8 GiB of RAM and 512 GB nVME storage. These machines run the latest version of Debian (12). In additions to the terminals, the SSL also has a server rack consisting mostly of Dell Poweredge R740 Systems, (2x 16C 32T 6th Gen Xeons) and 64 GiB RAM with 5 TB of RAID5 HDD Storage. You would also notice a few old Fujitsu racks, a Network Storage Device, a smaller Dell Rack. The racks under the control of student admins run Xen or Proxmox. /*TODO*/ get exact specs Retrieved from ‘https://wiki.fosscell.org/index.php?title=SSL&oldid=2571’",

      "title": "Ragam'25 Controversies and Alleged Saffronisation at NIT Calicut",
      "url": "https://wiki.fosscell.org/index.php?oldid=2586",
      "content": "The National Institute of Technology,Calicut has recently been at the center of a controversy involving the removal of content related to P. Rajan, a former student who became a symbol of resistance during India’s Emergency (1975-77). The incident has sparked widespread criticism, with some raising concerns about efforts to alter the institution’s historical narrative and saffronise its culture. Background P. Rajan, a student at the Regional Engineering College, Calicut (now NIT Calicut), was a victim of custodial death in 1976 during India’s Emergency. He died in police custody in Kakkayam, Kerala, under allegations of Naxalite involvement. Rajan was arrested, tortured, and killed by the police, which led to public outcry. His father,T.V. Eachara Warrier, played a pivotal role in bringing attention to the case, eventually leading to the conviction of the officers involved. Over time, Rajan’s story has become a significant part of Kerala's political and cultural history. In 1977, to honor his memory, the [[All-Kerala Rajan Memorial Music Festival]] was organized, though it was discontinued after a few years. The festival was revived in 1987 as Ragam, in continued remembrance of Rajan. The Removal of the Rajan’s Video As part of Ragam'25, the Ragam Team initially released a 2-minute, 32-second trailer video depicting the story of P. Rajan. The video referred to him as a \"legend\" and described him as a symbol of hope during dark times, who stood against injustice. The narration highlighted his use of art as a form of resistance, symbolizing the \"Ragam of revolution.\" However, this video was later removed from all official social media handles of Ragam'25 by the Ragam Team, following instructions from the administration, as it was seen to portray Rajan. This action sparked criticism from both the student community and alumni, who viewed it as a politically motivated decision. Many believe that removing Rajan’s legacy—especially given his history as a victim of autocratic violence and suppression of dissent—was part of a broader trend they perceive as an attempt to saffronise the institution. Some argue that this action is part of a series of moves by the administration to alter the apolitical nature of the institution. Allegations of Saffronisation There have been ongoing concerns among some students and alumni of NIT Calicut about what they perceive as a shift in the campus atmosphere from being apolitical to aligning with right-wing ideologies in recent years. These individuals point to several instances that they believe suggest an effort to saffronise the institution: 1. On 24 February 2023, an MoU was signed with the Kozhikode-based Mahatma Gandhi College of Mass Communication (MAGCOM), which is managed by the same trust that oversees The Kesari, a publication associated with the RSS. 2. On 8 February 2023, a program was organized by the club \"Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat\" at Aryabhatta Hall on the NIT Calicut campus. The event later surfaced on the ABVP Kerala social media handle, despite the student code of conduct strictly prohibiting political activities on campus. 3. A ceremony held at NIT Calicut saw the presence of Swami Chidanandapuri, a Hindu saint from Advaithashramam, who is believed to have ties with the RSS. He was invited to lay the foundation stone for the Labyrinth Garden under the Centre for Yoga and Holistic Wellness. Some critics viewed this as an event diverging from the institution's focus on promoting scientific temper, as it included a pooja associated with the stone-laying. 4. The protests on 22 January and the subsequent cancellations of Tathva’23 and Ragam’24 events. 5. Occasional efforts to diminish the legacy of P. Rajan, who is celebrated as a symbol of free speech, including the recent incident related to the Ragam’25 video removal. Public and Political Reactions The attempts to diminish the legacy of P. Rajan and concerns over the saffronisation of the institute have been met with strong opposition from the student community. In response to the 2023 events, a hunger strike was organized, while the controversies of 2024 prompted student protests. The removal of Rajan’s video also sparked significant backlash, with many students voicing their discontent. The Instagram page Students_Commune issued a statement expressing solidarity with Rajan’s memory, his father’s struggles, and the essence of Ragam, which is rooted in dissent against autocracy and the fight for free speech in the face of perceived authoritarianism. Conclusion The Rajan controversy at NIT Calicut serves as a stark reminder of the enduring importance of historical memory. As students and civil society continue to resist alleged attempts to erase Rajan’s legacy, the incident has become emblematic of the struggle to uphold democratic values and resist ideological domination in educational spaces.

Since his adoption, Selvaraj has charmed his family and friends with his endearing idiosyncrasies, culinary escapades, and an unusual passion for movies. Early Life and Adoption Selvaraj was adopted by his loving family at a young age. Shortly after his adoption, notable developmental changes were observed. One of the early milestones in his life was the descent of his testicles, which occurred approximately one month after his arrival—a development that, while within normal variation, marked the beginning of his transition into adolescence. Personality and Behavioral Quirks Selvaraj is known for his quirky and sometimes clumsy behavior. His family humorously describes him as having \"terrible reflexes\" and even refers to him as a \"stupid cat\" in a loving, teasing manner. Despite—or perhaps because of—these quirks, his unpredictable antics and occasional mishaps (earning him the playful moniker \"poopy boy\") have endeared him to those who know him best. His unique personality is a central part of his charm, making him both an amusing and cherished companion. Culinary Adventures While Selvaraj's everyday favorite food is kibble, his taste buds have led him on a few unexpected adventures. One particularly memorable incident involved a crab treat: so enamored with the delicacy that he bit the hand of Vinit with surprising force, resulting in a notable injury. This incident has become part of the family lore, highlighting both his strong food preferences and the dramatic flair with which he approaches life. Cinematic Journey One of the most distinctive aspects of Selvaraj's personality is his apparent passion for movies. His first memory with his new family involves watching Salmon 3D, an experience that set the stage for a lifelong (if unconventional) love affair with cinema. Over time, his viewing habits have expanded to include a wide range of films—from animated adventures to critically acclaimed dramas. Recently, Selvaraj has demonstrated a refined taste by watching Viduthalai Part 2, showing a particular interest in Tamil cinema and earning him admiration as a fan of actor Vijay Sethupathi. His cinematic adventures have not only enriched his daily life but have also provided endless entertainment and a unique point of connection among his human companions. Cultural Impact and Legacy Selvaraj’s journey—from his early developmental milestones to his adventurous spirit and cinematic endeavors—has left a lasting impression on his family and community. His antics, both humorous and dramatic, have woven him into the fabric of his household’s stories and memories. Known by two names that capture different facets of his identity, Selvaraj embodies the idea that every pet has a unique story worth celebrating. His legacy continues to grow with every new adventure, every quirky moment, and every shared film night. Retrieved from ‘https://wiki.fosscell.org/index.php?title=Shelby_The_Cat&oldid=2587’",

      "content": "Ragam Logo Ragam is South India’s largest Cultural fest hosted by National Institute of Technology, Calicut.[1] Ragam blends a series of fine arts, socio-cultural and literary events, along with a variety of workshops, exhibitions and informal events. The fest attracts thousands of visitors to the campus annually and is one of the most popular cultural fests in India.[2] History Over two decades have passed since the inception of Ragam. The humble yet controversial beginnings of this festival are well-known due to the infamous Rajan case that rocked Kerala in the seventies. Rajan, a student of the then CREC was taken into police custody during the Emergency period and allegedly died in custody in 1976.[1] In 1977 the All Kerala Rajan memorial music competition was started to commemorate his life. However, the same got discontinued in a few years. Later in 1987 the fest resurfaced as Ragam, an inter-college cultural fest in remembrance of Rajan. In 2006, Ragam was started with a solemn message ready by Eachara Warrier, father of late Rajan.[3] The prestigious ever-rolling Ragam trophy of \"Nataraj\", the trophy awarded to the overall champions at the fest, is considered as one of the most coveted prizes by the colleges in South India. The 31st edition of the fest was conducted in March 2017.[4] Pro Shows The Ragam pro-shows have always been noted for the celebrities who have performed at NIT Calicut. The shows are staged in the institute Football Ground, with a capacity of over 8000 spectators. Presently the Ragam \"nites\" include three cultural nites - ‘the inaugural nite’, ‘the highlight pro-show’, ‘the popular nite’. For the highlight pro-show, NIT Calicut has previously hosted some of the biggest singers in the country including popular youth icon Sunidhi Chauhan, Sukhwinder Singh, Shaan, Krishnakumar Kunnath (KK),[5] Farhan Akhtar, Sonu Nigam and Ankit Tiwari.[6] Most recently for Ragam'18, spectators had the opportunity to watch Vishal–Shekhar perform live.[7] Benny Dayal, Naresh Iyer,[5] Ranjith, Suraj Jagan and many more have taken the stage for the ‘Popular nite’, where a group of two or more singers perform for the crowds. Notable bands that have visited the fest in the past are Parikrama, Silk Route, Whitenoiz[8] and Motherjane along with tribute bands like Higher-on-maiden, Breathe the Floyd and Jail break. In 2011, Ragam witnessed a breathtaking performance by the 'Jai Ho' team. In 2009 Ragam became the first stage in Kerala to host a foreign band, with Breathe the Floyd, a tribute band to Pink Floyd.

      "content": "FOSSMeet is an annual event on Free and Open source software, conducted at National Institute of Technology, Calicut. Started with a vision to create a culture of innovation, evolution and open standards, the meet intends to support the FOSS community and the dissemination of FOSS ideology through hands-on sessions, discussions and lectures. FOSSMeet '25 is set to encompass discussions dealing with current trends in open source software and hardware, opportunities to contribute to FOSS, and workshops to familiarize attendees with the latest technologies. FOSSMeet '25, the seventeenth edition of FOSSMeet is scheduled from Friday, March 14 to Sunday, March 16, 2025. FOSSMeet’25, the 20th edition of NIT Calicut’s premier Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) conference, concluded on a high note, marking two decades of fostering open-source culture, innovation, and collaboration. The event brought together experts, students, developers, and industry professionals to celebrate and advance the spirit of open-source software. The conference began with inspiring opening notes from two legends of the FOSSMeet journey: Dr. Rajagopalan Anayath, a cornerstone of the event since its inception in 2005 until his retirement in 2023, and Praveen Arimbrathodiyil, one of the pioneers of FOSSMeet, who was a final-year student at NIT Calicut when the event began. Their talks took the audience on a nostalgic journey, reflecting on 20 years of FOSSMeet’s history, growth, and impact on the open-source ecosystem. The event featured an array of insightful talks by esteemed speakers from the open-source community. Harsh Lathwal guided attendees through creating a custom Linux distribution, while Jithin B P introduced KuttyPy, a tool for embedded systems programming. Bhuvana Meenakshi discussed building diverse and inclusive open tech communities, and Vipul A M shared insights on taking open-source projects from inception to IPO using Rails. Other notable talks included Open Board Design by Shreekumar, the Free Software Movement by Ajith Kumar, and an introduction to the Legal Aspects of Open Source by Ajshal C A. Het Joshi delivered a compelling session on Privacy-Preserving Technologies, and Anish Anil Kumar provided valuable insights on fostering open-source communities. Poruri Sai Rahul explored the importance of FOSS Policy at both the union and state levels. Hands-on workshops were a highlight of FOSSMeet’25, offering participants practical knowledge in emerging technologies. Topics ranged from Kotlin Programming by Amarjith Singh to an Introduction to eBPF by Madhav Prabhu. Aravind I M led an engaging workshop on Kubernetes, while Dr. Athul Joseph Manual shed light on the intersection of Technology & Palliative Care. Dr. Sunil Thomas T introduced attendees to Software Defined Radios, and Abhinav Garg and Christudasan Devadasan conducted an in-depth session on GPU Programming. Beyond talks and workshops, FOSSMeet’25 also hosted a Linux Super Tux Kart Competition, where participants showcased their gaming skills in an exciting contest. The event witnessed over 180 participants from across India, including students, industry professionals, and open-source contributors. With more than 15 distinguished speakers, FOSSMeet’25 successfully cultivated an environment where attendees could learn, collaborate, and contribute to the global open-source movement. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to our sponsors, speakers, mentors, volunteers, and participants who made this milestone event a grand success. Special thanks to the administration and faculty of NIT Calicut for their continued support in fostering open-source culture on campus. As the curtains close on this landmark edition, we look forward to an even more vibrant future for FOSSMeet and the open-source community.

      "content": "SPDC Scholarship The SPDC (Scholarship Program for Diaspora Children) is a financial assistance program aimed at helping students from Indian diaspora families pursue higher education in India. It is designed to support eligible students by covering a portion of their tuition fees and other educational expenses. This scholarship is administered by the Government of India and has specific guidelines for application and eligibility. The **Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)**, Government of India, introduced the “Scholarship Programme for Diaspora Children” (SPDC) in the academic year 2006-2007 for the children of **Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs)**, **Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs)**, and **Non-Resident Indians (NRIs)**. The program aims to assist these students in pursuing undergraduate courses in Indian Universities/Institutes and promote India as a center of higher studies. The SPDC was extended in **2015-16** to include the children of Indian workers in **Emigration Check Required (ECR) countries**, such as Afghanistan, Bahrain, Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Malaysia, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. In 2022-23, the scheme was further extended to include children of PIOs/OCIs and NRIs from all countries.
